  <name>Headless Man Amber Alt</name>
  <description>The ancient peoples that inhabited Wisconsin are known for building numerous celestial stone monuments and earthen effigy mounds to serve as symbols of their culture and their beliefs.&#xCA; Unfortunately, most of these structures have fallen victim to the farmer's plow over the past 150 years.&#xCA; Not far from the brewery, lying preserved on the floor of Rock Lake, are two effigy mounds - a Headless Man and a Turtle.&#xCA; Legend tells us, as the Turtle can survive on both land and in water, its spirit helped guide the Headless Man into the afterlife.&#xCA; May the Turtle's spirit guide you to happiness with a Headless Man Amber Alt.The Headless Man is brewed in the "old way" of a D&#x9F;sseldorf-style Altbier.&#xCA; A unique cold lagering process gives this amber ale its smooth taste.</description>
