  <description>Nothing beats a day at the beach...Ê the sun, the sand and, of course, the scenery.ÊHere in Lake Mills,Êthe three beaches of Rock LakeÊhave drawn young and old for generations... to laugh, to play, to frolic, to just escape stresses of life for a time.ÊThree Beaches Honey Blonde is like a day at the beach... light, bleached blonde, gleefully effervescent, free from bitterness and sure to improve your attitude.ÊWhen you need a little attitude adjustment, spend a day at the beach with Three Beaches Honey Blonde... and you won't even have to wash the sand out of your suit!Three Beaches Honey Blonde is our Wisconsin version of the American Blonde Ale. This beer is light-bodied with a sweet touch of honey and a mild citrus accent.</description>
