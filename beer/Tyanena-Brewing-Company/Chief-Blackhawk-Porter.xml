  <name>Chief BlackHawk Porter</name>
  <description>In 1767 a great Sauk leader was born. His name meant "the black sparrow hawk." He came to be known as Black Hawk. Strong beliefs, independent thinking and an unwavering commitment to his family and his people earned him a reputation as a man of integrity and courage. In 1832, along with 1,200 of his people, Black Hawk was driven from his ancestral home during a war that bears his name. We celebrate this Sauk leader and his courage with our BlackHawk Porter, the kind of beer that make you say, Ma-ka-tai-she-kia-kiak!The Black Hawk War was the last armed conflict between Indians and European settlers east of the Mississippi River in the Old Northwest Territory. Its resolution spawned rapid development enabling Wisconsin to achieve territorial status in 1836 and statehood by 1848.Chief BlackHawk Porter is a robust black and sharply bittersweet ale. This style was traditionally the session beer consumed by the porters in London.</description>
