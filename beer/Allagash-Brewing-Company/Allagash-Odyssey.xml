  <name>Allagash Odyssey</name>
  <description>Odyssey is the second edition in our Barrel Aged series. It is a dark, 10% ABV wheat beer. We age a portion of the beer in New American Medium Toast Oak, and a portion in stainless steel for more than six months. We then blend the two different portions of beer to taste. Finally we bottle condition, adding additional yeast and Candi sugar.</description>
