  <name>Allagsh Fluxus '08</name>
  <description>Another year, another batch of Fluxus has been brewed to mark the change and growth of Allagash Brewing. With a new and different recipe, our 2008 batch is a double white beer brewed with spices and fresh grated ginger. A double white beer calls for twice the amount of malted and raw wheat, which casts an elegant cloudiness over this mango-colored beer. The aroma boasts of herbal and minty notes, as well as hints of clove and candied ginger. Fluxus offers a perfectly balanced flavor with a warm, clean finish and a lingering spiciness.As part of our Tribute Series, Allagash is donating $1 from each bottle of Fluxus sold to the Allagash Pediatric Scholarship at the Maine Medical Center in Portland, Maine. The scholarship will directly support the training of a nurse, whether it be undergraduate, graduate or certification in the field of pediatric nursing. We are proud to donate to the nurses at MMC, who do an outstanding job</description>
