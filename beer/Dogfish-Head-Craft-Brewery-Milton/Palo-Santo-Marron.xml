  <description>Palo Santo Marron (Holy Tree Brown)
An unfiltered, unfettered, unprecedented brown ale aged in handmade wooden brewing vessels. The caramel and vanilla complexity unique to this beer comes from the exotic Paraguayan Palo Santo wood from which these tanks were crafted. Palo Santo means "holy tree"" and it's woodÂ has been used in South AmericanÂ wine-making communities.Â 
This beer isÂ a 12% abv, highly roasty, and malty brown ale aged on the Palo Santo wood.Â  It was a huge hit at our Rehoboth Beach brewpub when first released in November of 2006, so it's coming back... into full production!
Â At 10,000 gallons each, these are the largest wooden brewingÂ vessels built in America since before Prohibition.

It's all very exciting. We have wood. Now you do too.</description>
