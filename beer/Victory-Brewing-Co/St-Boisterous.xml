  <name>St. Boisterous</name>
  <description>A full-bodied lager beer of exuberant and robust character. It's muscle-man body comes from decocted German malts and noble German hops. Lagered long and cold to refine its strong temperament, St. Boisterous emerges smooth and seductive, with a malty sweet charm. This classic rendition of the German 'maibock' style will warm your heart.</description>
