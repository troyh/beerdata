  <description>Amber, aromatic strong ale... Our vintage-dated, Belgian-style specialty ale, offered in corked 25.4 oz. bottles, is a sensation in subtlety. Heady with a aromatic fruity start and taste, this amber ale features hints of pear and apricot in its well-nuanced flavor. The initial impression of fruitiness concludes in a refreshing dryness that begs you to sip again. Be fore- warned, this ale is immense as it registers 12% abv.</description>
