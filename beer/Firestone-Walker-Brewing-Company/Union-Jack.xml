  <description>The newest member of the Firestone family, Union Jack is the aggressive IPA that you've been searching for. Citrus, pineapple, and a full chewy malt profile finish clean on your palate. Over 70 IBUs and 7.5% alcohol by volume, Union Jack won't have any problem competing with the big India Pale Ales. A beer true to its origins; deeply hopped and bolstered for a long voyage.</description>
