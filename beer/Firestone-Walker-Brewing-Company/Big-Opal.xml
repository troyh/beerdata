  <description>Big Opal is a hearty wheat wine brewed for our anniversayr barrel-aging program. You will most likely see this blended into "Twelve" later this year. A hefty malt bill drives the alcohol over 9% and a blend of our House Ale yeast and Humboldt yeast adds to the complexity.</description>
