  <description>Abacus is a barrel aged Barley Wine.  Four barrels in total were selected for the blend.  The base of this year's o? ering was aged in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels for 3 years!  The resulting beer is strong yet extremely elegant and smooth.  Big boozy bourbon and American oak aromas combined with soft chocolate malty undertones.  Complex malt ßavors framed in oak, with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla, tobacco, coconut and just a touch of dark cherry.  Th is is deÞ nitely a sipping beer, best served in a brandy snifter.  Abacus pairs well with dark chocolate and sturdy cheeses. </description>
