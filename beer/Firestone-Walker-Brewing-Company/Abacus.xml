  <name>Abacus</name>
  <description>Abacus is a barrel aged Barley Wine.  Four barrels in total were selected for the blend.  The base of this year's o? ering was aged in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels for 3 years!  The resulting beer is strong yet extremely elegant and smooth.  Big boozy bourbon and American oak aromas combined with soft chocolate malty undertones.  Complex malt &#xDF;avors framed in oak, with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla, tobacco, coconut and just a touch of dark cherry.  Th is is de&#xDE; nitely a sipping beer, best served in a brandy snifter.  Abacus pairs well with dark chocolate and sturdy cheeses. </description>
