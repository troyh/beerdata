  <name>Pale 31 (California Pale Ale)</name>
  <description>One of the most award-winning American style pale ales in the country. This is the American beer style that started a revolution in taste. We've taken the classic British pale ale and elevated it with a wonderful dose of northwest American hops. A crisp floral hop aroma precedes a medium-bodied clean finishing ale.</description>
