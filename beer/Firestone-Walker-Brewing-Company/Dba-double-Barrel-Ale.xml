  <name>DBA (Double Barrel Ale)</name>
  <description>A British Pale Ale never tasted so fresh. We challenge our good friends across the pond to match this one. Can't be done. We've honored the traditions of the great British Pale brewers of Burton-on-Trent using our patented Firestone Union oak barrels. You're left with a mild blend of vanilla and toasted oak flavor touched with an elegant hint of English noble hops. DBA is the flagship of our company and wildly popular.</description>
