  <name>Yulesmith Holiday Summer Ale</name>
  <description>Our most popular seasonal ale, YuleSmith is brewed twice a year in two different, yet similar, styles: An Imperial / Double IPA and an Imperial / Double Red Ale. During the summer, YuleSmith is transformed into a big, hoppy, Double IPA. The enormous load of hops requires a substantial malt background to create just the right balance for a Double IPA. Lighter in color, summer YuleSmith is available around the 4th of July and is packaged in a red, white, and blue bottle.</description>
