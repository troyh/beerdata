  <name>Speedway Stout</name>
  <description>A HUGE Imperial Stout that weighs in at an impressive 12% ABV! As if that's not enough, we added pounds of coffee for a little extra kick. Our special-edition Brewer's Reserve Speedway Stout, which is aged in Bourbon barrels, has been rated the #1 BEST BEER IN THE WORLD at ratebeer.com. It was also featured on CNBC's "Squawk Box" in a segment on the best dark beers in America.</description>
