  <name>Longfellow Winter Ale</name>
  <description>Longfellow Winter Ale was first introduced in February 1995 to honor the poet Henery Wadsworth Longfellow. A full-bodied beer, Longfellow Winter Ale is almost a hybrid between a porter and Scottish ale, with a distinct roasted barley character. A well-balanced malty hoppiness comes through initially, and it finishes long and dry.</description>
