  <name>McGilligans IPA</name>
  <description>India Pale Ales, or IPA's, were brewed for British soldiers stationed in India. These ales needed to higher in alcohol and have more hops than normal to survive the long journey, and ours is no exception. Brewed with Belgian and German malts and dry hopped with loads of Cascades, our version honors our friend who had his own grueling journey involving a boat and cold water!</description>
