  <description>Just before his birthday, Bewmaster Steve concocts a special beer to reward himself for making it through another year in the brewery business. Full flavored, ever evolving, and usually barrel-aged! This years version is an Imperial IPA. High alcohol, very hoppy, and dry-hopped to the MAXIMUM!!! Happy Birthday to me!!!</description>
