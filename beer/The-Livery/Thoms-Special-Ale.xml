  <name>Thoms Special Ale</name>
  <description>This deep copper colored Ale is named after Steve's homebrew buddy Thom Phillips, who has had a part in helping to formulate some of the final Ale recipes at the Livery. Hints of caramel make their way through the aromatic bitterness of Centennial hops.</description>
