  <description>Brewmaster Steve took his Belgian Amber Ale and re-fermented it in a merlot cask with 100# of sweet Michigan cherries from Husteds Farm Market. He than moved the resulting beer into another cask with 30# of tart cherries. 5 fermentations due to wild yeast and 9 months later, we have our version of a Belgian Kriek. Named after our good friend and musician, April Verch.</description>
