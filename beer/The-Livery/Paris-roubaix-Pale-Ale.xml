  <name>Paris-Roubaix Pale Ale</name>
  <description>Named after one of the longest running bicycle races in France and aptly nicknamed "The Hell Of The North", the Paris-Roubaix has been held every April since 1915. This Pale Ale is brewed with Belgian and German malts and bittered with 3 different American hops for a pleasing balance.</description>
