  <description>Maillot Jaune, or "Yellow Shirt", is named for the jersey of honor given to the leader of the Tour De France bicycle race held every July. American Lance Armstrong is the only person in history to wear the Maillot Jaune 7 times in a row! Golden in color and blessed with a kiss of hop bitterness, this ale is also available barrel aged. Steve swears that he does not use any performance enhancing drugs in the production of this beer!</description>
