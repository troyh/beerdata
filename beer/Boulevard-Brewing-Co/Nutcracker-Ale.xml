  <description>Nutcracker Ale is Boulevard's holiday gift for real beer lovers. This hearty, warming brew is a classic winter ale, deep amber in color, with hints of molasses balanced by the "spiciness" of freshly harvested Chinook hops.\nSENSORY DESCRIPTION: Many foods don't stand up to this strong beer, so rich strong-flavored foods work best. Nutcracker Ale is also a great digestif. Flavor hooks: caramel, spice</description>
