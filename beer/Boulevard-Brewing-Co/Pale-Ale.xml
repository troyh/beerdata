  <description>Boulevard Pale Ale is a smooth, fruity, well-balanced beer with year-round appeal. A variety of caramel malts impart a rich flavor and amber color, while liberal use of whole hops adds zest and aroma. Pale Ale is the first beer we brewed, and continues to be a perennial favorite.\nSENSORY DESCRIPTION: Hoppiness can cut through greasy, fatty or mouth-coating foods, it can also compliment vinegar-based dishes, or seafood dishes; can enhance heavily spiced dishes. Flavor hooks: flowery spices</description>
