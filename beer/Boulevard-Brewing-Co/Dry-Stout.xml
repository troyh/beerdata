  <name>Dry Stout</name>
  <description>Velvety black and perfectly opaque, our bottled Dry Stout is the somewhat livelier companion to our popular draught version of this enduring style. This surprisingly smooth, drinkable beer is a delightful harmony of smoky roasted flavors and tangy, coffee-like notes.\nSENSORY DESCRIPTION: Light body pairs best with lighter flavored foods, although the roasted flavors allow a bit more leeway with richer, more full-flavored foods. Flavor hooks: chocolate, roasted flavors</description>
