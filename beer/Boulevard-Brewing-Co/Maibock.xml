  <description>First introduced in 2008, Boulevard Maibock is a new, limited-release seasonal brew. A welcome sign of Spring, this beer is a traditional German lager, lighter in color than other bocks. Boulevard's Maibock is a distinctive, refreshing take on this springtime classic.\nSENSORY DESCRIPTION: Medium golden color; caramel and malty with a light bitterness to balance the toasted malty flavors. The finish is crisp and refreshing.</description>
