  <name>Perkulator Coffee Dopplebock</name>
  <description>This is a true dopplebock and Dark Horse Brewing's only publicly distributed lager. It was so normal that we couldn't stand it so we made it into a coffee dopplebock. Ha, take that Germany, with your Reinheitsgebot purity law! Anyway, we use fare trade organic coffee from our friends at The Ugly Mug Cafe in Ypsilanti, MI</description>
