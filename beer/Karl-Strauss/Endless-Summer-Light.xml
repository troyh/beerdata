  <name>Endless Summer Light</name>
  <description>Endless Summer Light tastes refreshing whether you like putting your toes to the nose or just in the sand. A blend of Vienna malts and pale barley give this flavorful low-calorie lager a firm malt center and golden color. Noble Saaz hops provide a subtle hop character and crisp clean finish.  In June of 2005, Bruce Brown Films and Karl Strauss Brewing Company came together to create Endless Summer Light as a tribute to two pioneers, Bruce Brown, legendary filmmaker and creator of the classic surf film, "The Endless Summer," and Karl Strauss, Master Brewer.</description>
