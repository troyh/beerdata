  <name>Amber Lager</name>
  <description>In the beginning... we created Karl Strauss Amber Lager. Generous amounts of caramel and Munich malts give the beer rich caramel flavors, balanced by a background of Cascade hops. After the beer is cold fermented for a clean, smooth finish, we filter it - not once, but twice- to enhance its bright, bronze color. Our flagship Amber Lager was also Karl's favorite beer.</description>
