  <name>Beatification</name>
  <description>Beatification is a 100% spontaneously fermented beer using the oldest barrels that no longer have any wine flavor or oak flavor left in them. However, a cocktail of "bugs and critters"(Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus &amp; other wild yeast &amp; bacteria.) remains in the barrel. This isn't the only place where the beer picks up its ability to ferment, before the unfermented beer heads into the oak barrels, the beer has already sat "horny" and picked up many other wild yeasts to start its life towards a true, spontaneously fermented beer.</description>
