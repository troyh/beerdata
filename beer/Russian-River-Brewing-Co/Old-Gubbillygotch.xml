  <description>Barleywine is a strong style of ale that has an alcohol content that closer resembles a wine. Our copper-colored barleywine offers big malt flavors that are balanced with a large infusion of hops in the kettle. Although this ale has a high than normal bittering unit rating, the bitterness in the beer balances out extremely well with the residual sweetness from the malt.</description>
