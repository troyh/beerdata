  <description>"If you can't feel good about your beer... what else is worth feeling good about." We call Beer Esteem a California Common because it is brewed with a lager yeast and it is fermented at warmer ale temperatures. However, Beer Esteem is distinctly different from other California Commons. With a unique hop profile, a lager yeast not typically used for the style, and a "Russian River" twist, Beer Esteem is anything but "Common."</description>
