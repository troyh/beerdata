  <name>Santa's Little Helper 2008</name>
  <description>Mikkeller Christmas beer anno 2008. Santa's Little Helper is a dark, strong Belgian ale, lightly spiced with sweet orange peel, coriander seeds, cinnamon and cocoa. This year's version is recognized by less sweetness than the 2007 version, a fresh hop bite, balanced by the sweetnes from the coriander and orange peel and a big bold body. Enjoy now or keep it in the cellar for many years to come.</description>
