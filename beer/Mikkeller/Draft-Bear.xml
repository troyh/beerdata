  <description>A Danish pilsner is typically characterized by an alcohol content of 4,6% vol., piss-yellow colour and a sexless, slightly bitter taste. But it doesn't have to be like this...! Draft Bear is Mikkellers interpretation of a 'pilsner', heavyweight-style. With its powerful hop notes, high alcohol content and lovely golden appearance, the only reference to the pilsner style is the clean taste of the lager yeast.</description>
