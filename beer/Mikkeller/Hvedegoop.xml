  <description>Hvedegoop is a so-called wheatwine, which is a barley wine style, where wheat-malt is used in the brewing. Hvedegoop has a beautiful clear amber color, moderate snow-white foam, and a very strong scent of citrus fruit and pine. The taste is dominated by hops, which stands in sharp contrast to the sweetness and rich body.</description>
