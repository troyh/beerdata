  <description>All Others Pale - as in 'All Others Pale By Comparison' - is our cheeky take on an American tradition, but, naturally, with a Danish touch. It is a well-balanced, light-bodied thirst quencher, perfect after a hard day's work or on hot summer days... but loads of fresh green hops and a subtle malty background makes this pale ale the refreshing choice year 'round!</description>
