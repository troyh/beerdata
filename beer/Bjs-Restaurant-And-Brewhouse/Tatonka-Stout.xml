  <name>Tatonka Stout</name>
  <description>An Imperial Stout -- a classic style so rich and flavorful that it was once the private beverage of Russian Czars. The profile is malty sweet, hop bitter roasted, full-bodied, alcoholic, and deliciously complex. Beer doesn't get much more intense than this!</description>
