  <name>Odd Notion Winter 07</name>
  <description>The first Odd Notion to be revealed is Dark Wheat Ale. Brewed with 50 percent malted wheat and lightly hopped, its an enticingly deep brown, full-bodied ale with a slightly fruity nose of roasted malts. On the palate, it offers a rich roasted malt flavor and a distinctive character endowed with warm notes of cocoa, toffee, and caramel. Drinkers will find it has a low level of malt astringency balanced by a malty sweetness that provides a perfect finish. Debuting in Magic Hats Feast of Fools winter Variety 12-pak, it will also be on draught at savvy establishments that pour Magic Hat elixirs. </description>
