  <name>Sierra Nevada Harvest Series Wet Hop</name>
  <description>The cornerstone of our Harvest series is the beer that started the modern-day fresh hop ale phenomenon in America, our original Harvest Ale.Created in 1996, Harvest Ale features Cascade and Centennial hops from the Yakima Valley in Eastern Washington. These hops are harvested and shipped as "wet" un-dried hopsthe same day they are pickedto our brewery in Chico where our brewers eagerly wait to get them into the brew kettle while their oils and resins are still at their peak.</description>
