  <description>Named for a medieval Scottish sword, Claymore Scotch Ale is our tribute to the legendary "Wee Heavy" beers of Scotland. This malty, deep-ruby beauty features lots of caramel sweetness, a reserved hop profile, and a subtle warming character. Unlike its namesake, this beer only requires one hand, but it'll still make you feel like nobility.</description>
