  <name>Ale</name>
  <description>Harpoon Ale was the first in the family of Harpoon beers. It is important to know that when it was first brewed in 1987, there were virtually no other American Pale Ales or Amber Ales available in Boston, let alone an ale brewed within the city limits. Harpoon Ale was the product of extensive research and test brews by Harpoon's founders to find the right beer to launch the Harpoon Brewery. \nIt has a loyal following to this day.When first seeing Harpoon Ale in a glass, you will notice its golden caramel color. You will also see that it is not excessively carbonated. High carbonation would mask this beer's subtle flavor. The first aroma will be fruity. This is produced by the yeast and is a signature characteristic of Harpoon's proprietary yeast strain. The second perceptible aroma is from the malt, with a delicate caramel note. Upon tasting Harpoon Ale, you will find that the malty, fruity character is nicely balanced by the mild hop bitterness. It has a smooth, medium body. The finish of this beer is crisp but not dry.\n\nThe overall character of this beer is fruity, balanced, and mild.</description>
