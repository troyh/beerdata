  <name>Brown Session Ale</name>
  <description>Harpoon Brown is brewed to accentuate the sweeter, rounder notes derived from six different malts, including a de-husked chocolate malt that adds a hint of chocolate. The blend of these malts produces a beer that is complex and delicious without being heavy. This drinkable beer is perfect as a session beer or paired with foods.\nThis is the first year-round Harpoon beer the brewery has released in almost a decade. While the craft beer industry has seen a growing trend in "extreme" beers, the brewers of Harpoon wanted to create something they could sit down and enjoy over an extended period of time - a session beer. At 4.3% alcohol by volume, the Harpoon Brown Ale has the lowest alcohol content of all Harpoon beers.</description>
