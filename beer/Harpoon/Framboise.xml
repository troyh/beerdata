  <description>Framboise, French for "raspberry", is a Belgian-style fruit lambic. Made with more than 4,600 pounds of raspberries, 50% wheat at a gravity of 14&#xA1;p it has all the makings of a great summer time beer. Highly carbonated, it produces a wonderfully pink, lacey head. The burgundy color foretells of intense raspberry aromas. A nice, sweet start finishing with a tart and acidic finish that is light and refreshing.</description>
