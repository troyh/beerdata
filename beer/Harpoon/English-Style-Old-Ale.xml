  <name>English Style Old Ale</name>
  <description>Harpoon Old Ale is inspired by the sustaining winter offerings of many English breweries. This complex &amp; malty brew is marked by significant alcohol warmth, balanced bitterness, biscuit/roasted undertones, and sublime mouthfeel. Proper English yeast, traditional hop varietals, and generous malt bill create a wonderful companion for the fireside. Enjoyable for consumption now or for extended cellaring.</description>
