  <description>The Harpoon 100 Barrel Series Smoked Porter is brewed with German beechwood rauch malt and a blend of eight other malts. This porter style ale is full-bodied and malty. The smoked malt imparts a complex but pleasant aroma and flavor with a balanced and subtle hop finish.</description>
