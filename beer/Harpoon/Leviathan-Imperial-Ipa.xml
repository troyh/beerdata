  <description>Harpoon Leviathan Imperial IPA will challenge your senses and your palate. As the vibrant aroma rushes out of your glass you will notice the blend of piney and tropical fruit notes. At first sip, this big beer starts with apowerful hop bitterness up frontand an aggressive hop flavor and character throughout. \nLeviathan Imperial IPA is brewed with tons of pale malt and just enough caramel malt to provide a sweet malt body to balance the hop intensity. We used copious amounts of a variety of hops including Chinook, Centennial, Simcoe, and Amarillo at various points during the boil to create a complex hop flavor and clean lingering bitter finish. We then fermented the beer with Harpoon's own versatile proprietary yeast. Finally, we dry hopped at a rate of over 1 lb a barrel to produce this beer's massive aroma.</description>
