  <description>Latin for "wheat," Triticus is a strong and dark Wheat Wine style ale that's light and lively on the palate. The blend of 50% wheat malts, including caramel and chocolate, provides color and depth of flavor. Complex hopping and dry-hopping lends a delicate spiciness and just enough balance to complement its strength. Best shared with friends.</description>
