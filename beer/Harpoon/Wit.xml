  <description>Our Wit features a cloudy yellow body with a rich white head. The nose is simply beautiful: curacao, orange peel, and coriander dominate. Light bodied with a soft yeast and spice mix, it finishes smooth with a slight tartness and spice. The perfect beer for a summer afternoon.</description>
