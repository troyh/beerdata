  <name>Imperial Stout</name>
  <description>Imperial Stout had its noble beginnings in the late 18th century to appease the Tsarist courts of Empress Catherine II. With an original gravity of 19&#xA1; P, high percentages of roasted barley, brown and caramel malts, and the finest noble English hops, this beer will surely keep the winter chill off.</description>
