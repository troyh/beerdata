  <description>The big, malty scent of the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series Maibock is present just above the floral hop nose. The combination of five malts creates a full, smooth texture that yields a clean, dry bitterness. This is a full-bodied beer with a pronounced hop and malt character.</description>
