  <description>Everyone knows some of our best friends are wine growers from the Libourne region in France, more specifically those who make Saint Emillion and Pomerol. They respect the tradition and let their wine ferment in a natural way. Fermentation, origin and vintage are still kept up.\nOur collaboration resulted in a product uniting the best of their wine and of our beer : the Saint-Lamvinus.The grapes, of the merlot and cabernet-franc varieties, are soaked in Bordeaux barrels containing two to three years old lambic. The beer is not blended before the bottling. The foam is caused by the addition of a liquor which starts the fermentation. </description>
