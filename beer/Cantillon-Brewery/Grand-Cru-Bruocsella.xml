  <description>The Lambic Grand Cru Bruocsella Cantillon is a lambic which has matured for three years in oakwood barrels and has been selected for its exceptional colour, taste and flavour.Its light, slightly amber, yellow-gold colour and its aroma, a mixture of apples and honey, make the Grand Cru Bruocsella a very seductive beer.Its taste derives from its dry character and its slight and discreet acidity.When kept for a long time, its bouquet gets the fine flavour of roasted bread which, according to some, relates it to the white Burgundy "Chardonnay"This aristocratic beer is to our national beer patrimony what Mouton-Rotschild, Petrus or Romane-Conti are to the wines.\nJust like these top quality wines, the Lambic Grand Cru Bruocsella is not drunk but savoured and it can be served with the finest dishes.\nIts subtle taste enhances the savour of stewed dishes, underlines discreetly the taste of fish and crustaceans and constitutes a strong support for the taste of fine meat. Combined with sauerkraut, it tastes to full advantage.The beer is unique in the world. Its fermentation is spontaneous, without the addition of yeast, and is the result of the action of micro-organisms.After maturing for three years in oakwood barrels, it looks more like wine and its fine taste and flavours nearly make one forget that the Grand Cru Bruocsella Cantillon is a beer. This old lambic is bottled without any addition.The taste of the Grand Cru Bruocsella Cantillon will change in course of time and the beer can be kept for years. We recommend our customers to savour this old Lambic in wine glasses (tasting glasses).A matchless, marvelous, eternal beerÉ</description>
