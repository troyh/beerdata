  <name>Agave Wheat</name>
  <description>This true American-style unfiltered wheat has something a little special -- the nectar of the great Salmiana Agave. Agave complements the refreshingly light quality of our wheat and adds a subtle note of flavor that expands this beer's uplifting taste profile. It is familiar, yet creative.</description>
