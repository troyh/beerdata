  <description>Desire coupled with curiosity can drive you to do many foolish things.Fortunately, opening a bottle of our Pandora's Bock is not one of them. Once it is released, a wealth of flavor and complexity will spill out into the world. With a traditional bock flavor profile and a hint of hoppy goodness, there's a reason it's spoken about in mythical terms.</description>
