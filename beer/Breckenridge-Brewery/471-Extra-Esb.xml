  <name>471 Extra ESB</name>
  <description>Extra, extra? You better believe it. We like to say it's double extra special. The balance of malt and hops makes it truly one-of-a-kind. Warming malt notes at the onset with a hop kick in the back and opens up to a nice dry finish. Our small batch ESB is a big traditional ale with characteristics that break tradition and a complexity that constantly surprises.</description>
