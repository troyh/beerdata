  <description>This is our German wheat ale, a true Hefe Weizen. This refreshing, unfiltered, golden, wheat beer uses a unique Bavarian yeast strain to impart a fruity, spicy character which is classic for this style. Our Wine Country Wheat Ale is very distinct, high in carbonation, and displays a thick creamy head. Often served with a slice of lemon, this is a great beer to drink on a hot summer day in Healdsburg.</description>
