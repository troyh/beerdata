  <description>What do you get when you age an Imperial Stout for 6 months in an old, rye-whiskey, oak barrel? We call it Black Rye. Served cask style, we're sure you'll enjoy its robust, roasty heartiness courted by a vanilla-like whiskey undertone that's sure to put hair on your paws! Cheers!</description>
