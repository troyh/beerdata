  <name>Heritage Ale</name>
  <description>This beer is fermented at a lower temperature than our standard ales, giving it a very malty taste. Scottish and English malts are melded together with English hops to create its bold, sweet, malty finish. The caramel color comes from a blending of UK Kent Goldings, but only in small amounts to allow malt flavors to come through. Be careful, it is bold with an alcohol level of 7.6%. Like a fine single malt, this hearty brew will get better with age.</description>
