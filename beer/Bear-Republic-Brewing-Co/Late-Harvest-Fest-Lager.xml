  <name>Late Harvest Fest Lager</name>
  <description>This malty, copper-colored lager is styled after Munich's traditional "Oktoberfest" beers. A full-bodied, rich malt character is balanced by a slight bitter finish. Perfect for cooler fall days, it is lagered for five weeks. Prost!!</description>
