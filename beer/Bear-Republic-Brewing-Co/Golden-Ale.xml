  <name>Golden Ale</name>
  <description>At the lighter end of the malt, hop and color spectrum, it offers a refreshing departure from the higher alcohol, or hoppier ales. With low bitterness and a light honey-like sweetness in the finish, this is a very drinkable, summer "session" ale.</description>
