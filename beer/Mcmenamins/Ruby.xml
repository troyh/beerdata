  <description>In 1986, McMenamins first used fruit in the creation of its ales. While many other breweries have followed suit, we still make this Ruby exactly as we first did: Light, crisp and refreshingly fruity. 42 pounds of Oregon-grown and processed raspberry puree are used in every batch. Taste the original!</description>
