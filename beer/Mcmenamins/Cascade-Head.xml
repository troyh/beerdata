  <name>Cascade Head</name>
  <description>Cascade Head ale, being one of our lightest beers, was named after the National Wildlife Preserve in Lincoln City, Oregon. It is a light, crisp, golden ale and is a good choice for those whose palates are accustomed to America's light lagers. Hopped exclusively with the noble Hallertauer, Cascade Head is a refreshing option for those who prefer their ales a little less aggressive.</description>
