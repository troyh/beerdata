  <description>This golden bitter uses fresh Cascade hops in modest amounts to create a more subtle hop flavor and bitterness than its big brother, Hammerhead. Nebraska Bitter was first brewed at the Fulton Pub &amp; Brewery, located in Southwest Portland. This crisp and flavorful ale has become a standard attraction at McMenamin's taps everywhere.</description>
