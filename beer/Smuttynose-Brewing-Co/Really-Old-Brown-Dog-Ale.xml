  <name>Really Old Brown Dog Ale</name>
  <description>Old Ale (also known as "Stock" Ale), is a full-bodied beer with high levels of dextrins. In times past, this beer was typically laid up to mature, hence the name. The color varies from rich, dark amber to a very dark brown. This style features fruity, vinuous &amp; deep, malty flavors, giving it an almost port-like qualities. Sight acidity is not uncommon.Olive, iconic mascot &amp; spirit guide of our brewery, first appeared on our Old Brown Dog label in 1994 &amp; returned, thirteen years later, to pose for our Really Old Brown Dog, a luscious, malt-rich, full bodied "old ale" featuring deep notes of complex fruit. Much like our beloved Olive, this beer will mellow &amp; age gracefully.</description>
