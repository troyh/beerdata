  <name>Old Brown Dog Ale</name>
  <description>Old Brown Dog has been cited as a classic example of the ÒAmerican Brown AleÓ style of beer. Compared to a typical English Brown Ale, Old Brown Dog is fuller-bodied and more strongly hopped. Old Brown Dog has been around for many years. It was first brewed in 1988 at the Northampton Brewery. In 1989 it won a silver medal in its category (American Brown Ale) at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver.</description>
