  <description>Light, tasty &amp; full of character, our summer wheat ale is brewed with a combination of domestic and continental wheat and barley malts, lightly hopped &amp; fermented with a Belgian wit yeast, resulting in a delightfully tangy &amp; refreshing flavor. This beer is brewed for warm weather enjoyment. Bring some to your next picnic, barbeque or Frisbee game. Available in sixpacks and on draft from May through August.</description>
