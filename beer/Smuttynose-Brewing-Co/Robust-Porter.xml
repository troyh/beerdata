  <name>Robust Porter</name>
  <description>This hearty, mahogany colored ale is brewed to evoke the dark, full-bodied ales that were a favorite of dockworkers and warehousemen (hence the name &#xD2;Porter&#xD3;) in 19th century London. It is a good bet that when Dickens&#xD5; Mr. Pickwick sat down for a pint, we would have been drinking an ale much like our Robust Porter.This is a smooth and very drinkable beer, characterized by its well-balanced malt and hops, plus subtle notes of coffee and chocolate.</description>
