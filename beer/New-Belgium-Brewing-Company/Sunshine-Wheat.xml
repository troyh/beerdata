  <description>SUNSHINE WHEAT is a great beer for trouncing thirst. Yet, it has a depth of character that inspires a quiet moment's reflection. Sunshine Wheat swirls in the mouth with ripples of coriander and orange peel tartness, settling nicely into a tranquil sea of apple and honey tones.A filtered wheat beer, Sunshine offers a crisp, refreshing alternative to heavier-bodied heffe-weizens.\nContinuing with the love of the great outdoors, we introduced Sunshine Wheat in 12-Packable Cans. From fishing to camping to festivals, now you can take the Sunshine with you</description>
