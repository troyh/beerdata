  <description>Deep amber brown with a dense off-white head, Dunkelweiss 30&#xA1;rediscovers hefeweissbiers through a Belgian brewer's lens. Envisioned by our own Matty &#xD2;Smooth&#xD3; Gilliland, this beer opens with sweet clove and banana notes that give way to a chocolaty warm finish with a peppery tingle across the palate. "I thought it would be fun to make a German wheat beer; we've explored the Belgian wheats pretty thoroughly," said brewer, Matt Gilliland. "Since this is Lips of Faith &#xD0; and part of what makes that program fun is to make beers that are really unique and different &#xD0; making a big, strong, dark Weiss beer sounded pretty folly-licious. It'll still showcase all of the flavors that a Hefeweiss beer would have, but add in the burly body and extra punch. Think of it as a Gran Cru dunkelweiss."</description>
