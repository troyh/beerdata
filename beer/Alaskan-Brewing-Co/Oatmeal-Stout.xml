  <description>The unique blend of the oats and malts in Alaskan Stout produce a balanced, smooth beer with hints of coffee and caramel. Alaskan Stout was originally brewed as a Rough Draft for our customers in Alaska. The popularity of the Stout allowed it to become the Brewery's fourth year-round product in the fall of 1998. </description>
