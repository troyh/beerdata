  <description>This is our Oktoberfest style lager. This beer is well balanced with Noble hop additions which provide a subtle bouquet and a nice malty nose. The flavor is unique and inviting, providing a full bodied beer from rich caramel, and other hearty malted grains. A highly sought after seasonal.</description>
