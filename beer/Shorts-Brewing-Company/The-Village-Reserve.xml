  <name>The Village Reserve</name>
  <description>This beer is fermented from wort extracted from fully modified two-row pale malt, which results in its beautiful golden color. This beer is aggressively hopped, which supports a medium body and allows the hop flavor and aroma to become more prominent throughout the beer. Village Reserve is uniquely its own due to its exclusive yeast strain. A great balance of malt and hops make it our version of good ol' fashioned beer.</description>
