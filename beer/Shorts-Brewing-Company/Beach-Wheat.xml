  <description>Classic wheat beer brewed by Americans in America using a German wheat yeast. 50% of the grain used is malted wheat designating it as a true "wheat" beer. This ale is also known as Hefeweizen. It's golden in color and light and clean with esters of banana and clove compliments of its Bavarian DNA. A beer so popular and easy drinking, it made it on this list.</description>
