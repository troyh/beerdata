  <name>Pandemonium Pale Ale</name>
  <description>Our classic American pale ale lends its copper color to the rich specialty grains. This craft ale is balanced with four kettle hop additions to a near IPA quality. It is one of the few beers we finish through whole leaf hops lending a nice fresh earthy aroma and flavor.</description>
