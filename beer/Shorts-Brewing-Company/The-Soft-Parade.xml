  <description>A fermented potion we call fruit rye ale. This gourmet specialty is engineered of toasted rye flakes and two row malted barley. These ingredients make a beer that we ferment with freshly pureed strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. The result is a sweet effervescent fruit delicacy most notable for its alluring color and drink ability.</description>
