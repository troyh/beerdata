  <description>A seasonal blend of pumpkin, spices, and carefully formulated ale. Notably aromatic of pumpkin pie, and the color of a light pastel brown, this brew is especially true of ale and comfortably consumable. Brewed with real pumpkin and real spice, it's still very much a beer, but beautifully engineered with spice, pumpkin and beer balance.</description>
