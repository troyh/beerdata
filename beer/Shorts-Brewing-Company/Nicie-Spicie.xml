  <description>Northern Michigan spiced wheat ale. A 50% mixture of premium two-row malted barley and malted white wheat makes this gorgeous golden beer balanced to support bold spiciness. This ale is loaded with fresh citrus zest, coriander, and a four pepper blend. So extremely satisfying you would think it was the finest beer ever made!</description>
