  <name>Stellar Ale</name>
  <description>A strong pale ale, light orange to copper in color somewhere between IPA and Pale Ale. It has a medium body and is well known for its hop profile. Exclusive hop variety is thorough and is the highlight of this ale. Quite pungent to the nose with a creamy spicy grapefruit, and light esters of toasted caramel. When fused onto the tongue, hop oil resin and medium maltiness extrude maximum delight and fulfillment. A compliment to the fine establishment -- Trattoria Stella in the Village Commons, Traverse City</description>
