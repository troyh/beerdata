  <name>The Bellaire Brown</name>
  <description>A brown ale so rich, it's hardly classifiable as brown. It's born of copious amounts of hearty pale ale malt, and several specialty selections which make it a dark, rich and delicious masterpiece. Very light hop additions allow the malty sweetness and flavor complexity to be most protuberant. A beer so user friendly, we dub this the "gateway" beer.</description>
