  <description>The Beach wheat is so popular, sometimes we'll make it in the winter if we have an open tank and re-name it for the winter pub goers. Classic wheat beer brewed by Americans in America using a German wheat yeast. 50% of the grain used is malted wheat designating it as a true "wheat" beer. This ale is also known as Hefeweizen.</description>
