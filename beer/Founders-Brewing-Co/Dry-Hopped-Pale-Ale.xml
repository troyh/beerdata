  <name>Dry Hopped Pale Ale</name>
  <description>A testament to Cascade hops in a bottle. This medium-bodied pale ale has a distinctive floral hop aroma and refreshing citrus flavor. You'll notice a slight malty sweetness with a balanced hop finish. Perfect to enjoy anytime, anywhere.</description>
