  <name>Backwoods Bastard</name>
  <description>Big and delicious for your 'perty mouth. Expect lovely, warm smells of single malt scotch, oaky bourbon barrels, smoke, sweet caramel and roasted malts, a bit of earthy spice and a scintilla of dark cherries. It's a kick-back sipper made to excite the pallet.</description>
