  <name>Centennial IPA</name>
  <description>Get ready to bask in the glory of the frothy head's floral bouquet. Relish the citrus accents from the abundance of dry-hopping. This one's sweet, yet balanced. Malty undertones shake hands with the hop character for a finish that never turns too bitter.</description>
