  <description>This is a full-bodied strong beer with a caramel and alcohol bouquet. This beer has an intense malt character and strong caramel flavours due to prolonged boiling during the brewing process. Butter flavours can also be found in the beer. The hops discretely shine through the sweetness and the alcohol, just enough to balance the strong malt presence. Subtle roasted and sweet flavours pull through in the aftertaste.</description>
