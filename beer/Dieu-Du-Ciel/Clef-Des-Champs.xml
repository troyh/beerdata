  <name>Clef Des Champs</name>
  <description>Inspired by ancestral brewing techniques that used a variety of available local herbs and spices instead of hops (this type of beer is often called "gruit"), this beer has amber-red hues and a lace like head. Typical Scottish herbs (heather and mugwort) are used for this beer. Gruit is an ancient beer style, from a time when hop was little-known and rarely used in brewing. This is an atypical beer, very floral, thin, and slightly caramelized.</description>
