  <description>Brewed with malted wheat, this golden coloured effervescent beer has a thick, compact head which sticks to the glass. The aromas are those of clove, banana and fresh baked bread. The bitterness is quite subtle, resulting in a beer that is smooth and fruity with a touch of acidity in the aftertaste.</description>
