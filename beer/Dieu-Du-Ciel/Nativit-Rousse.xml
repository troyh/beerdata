  <name>NATIVIT&#x83; ROUSSE</name>
  <description>A red beer with a dense head, the Nativit&#x8E; Rousse offers aromas of lightly roasted wheat and a touch of clove. It is full-bodied with a trace of sweetness and balanced with a touch of acidity. The bitterness of the hops makes its presence felt subtly in the aftertaste.</description>
