  <description>A revisited English Pale Ale! This is an exact replica of the traditional style, except for the addition of a large quantity of rye. The rye brings about an interesting spicy flavour as well as a silky texture. The bitterness is relatively mild. This beer was first brewed to celebrate Dieu du Ciel's 7th anniversary.</description>
