  <description>This is a cross between an Indian Pale Ale and an Irish Cream Ale. It is therefore an amber ale with malt-caramel and fruity flavours, the latter being a by-product of the English style yeast used during the brewing process. The beer has a mild hoppy flavour as well as a discrete alcohol taste. Overall, the beer is complex and full-bodied and wonderfully balanced. The beer, as in the Irish Cream Ale tradition, is pressurized with a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, resulting in a less effervescent beer, but with a rich, creamy head.</description>
