  <description>The imposture was the result of an experiment by the brewer in which he brewed a Weizen type beer and added buckwheat instead of wheat. The resulting beer has the characteristic flavours of Weizens (due to the use of a particular yeast), but it is dryer and darker in colour.</description>
