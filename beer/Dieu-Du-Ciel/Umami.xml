  <description>The Umami is a red German beer, hardly fruity, but with lovely malt and cereal flavours complemented by a delicate bitterness. Morels, added in very large quantities in the beer, are very subtle in the bouquet and in the mouth. They bring about a mild smoky taste and surround all the other flavours in a veil of delicate sweetness, as well as giving the beer certain dryness.</description>
