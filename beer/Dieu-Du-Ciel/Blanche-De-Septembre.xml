  <description>This traditional looking beer is actually at the intersection of a German and Belgian wheat beer. The coriander is very present at the start, followed with a tinge of citrus aromas and the smell of fresh baked bread. To the taste, the beer is mild and fruity with a delicate citrus acidity. The coriander and the ginger fill the mouth and a subtle yeast flavour is present in the aftertaste.</description>
