  <name>SIXI&#xE9;ME SOIR</name>
  <description>This beer was specially brewed for Dieu du Ciel&#xD5;s sixth anniversary. It reflects the recent tendency of American brewers to push all beer styles to the extremes. This lager is therefore quite strong in alcohol and it has a sharp but delicate bitterness, like all pilsners. The beer is full-bodied and well balanced thanks to the delicate sweet flavours that come through.</description>
