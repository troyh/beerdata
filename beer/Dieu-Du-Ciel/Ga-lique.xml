  <description>This is an amber ale with a creamy white head. It has a full-bodied taste, without any heaviness. The first draught brings about malty and roasted malt flavours. The aftertaste is of caramel and slight bitterness. Pressurized with nitrogen, like a stout, it is a simply refreshing beer, but full of taste.</description>
