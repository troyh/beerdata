  <name>&#x83;LIXIR C&#x83;LESTE</name>
  <description>Golden coloured lager with a head as white as snow. This beer has complex malt and hop flower aromas. It is full-bodied and the aftertaste is smooth and malty with a touch of sulphur. The noble hops used in this beer bring about a sharp but delicate bitterness.</description>
