  <name>SOLSTICE D'&#x83;T&#x83; AUX CERISES</name>
  <description>German inspired sour wheat beer. The obvious and domineering acidity of this beer is obtained by letting the unboiled wort go sour for several days. The Solstice d&#xD5;&#x83;t&#x8E; is made complete by the addition, during the fermentation process, of a phenomenal quantity of whole fruit (raspberries or cherries) which compensate for the sourness of the beer. The result is a very refreshing beer where both acidity and fruity flavours dominate wholeheartedly.</description>
