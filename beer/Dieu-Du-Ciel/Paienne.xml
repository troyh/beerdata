  <description>Paienne is a top-fermenting June straw blond coloured beer. It presents aromas of malt, fruits and hops. Its well-balanced flavours are dominated by malty and fresh cereals tastes, completed by a delicate bitterness. All of this makes the Paienne an inviting and thirst-quenching beer offering at the same time satisfying tastes and a generous body.</description>
