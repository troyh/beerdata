  <name>CHARBONNI&#xE9;RE</name>
  <description>Brewed in the tradition of the smoked ales of Bamberg (Germany), this amber ale has delicate malty and smoky aromas. It is full-bodied, malty and slightly sweet to the taste, and the smoky flavour is fully expressed with every draught. An original and distinctive beer, La Charbonni&#x8F;re is a house specialty. It is very much appreciated by beer enthusiasts who happily discover a type of beer that is rarely available on the market.</description>
