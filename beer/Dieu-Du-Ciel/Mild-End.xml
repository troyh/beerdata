  <name>Mild End</name>
  <description>Amber ale in the most authentic English tradition. This light beer with a very low alcohol content has fruity flavours, with a touch of caramel and bitterness. A perfect beer to accompany long evenings spent in deep conversation. This beer is named after the neighbourhood in which the brewpub is located, the Mile-End.</description>
