  <description>Fumisterie is a beer that sits at the intersection of an english and german ale. It is full-bodied, malty and has a slight caramel flavour. The organic hemp seeds incorporated during the brewing process give it a unique and original taste. The hop flavour comes through delicately in the after taste.</description>
