  <name>RIGOR MORTIS BLONDE</name>
  <description>This monastic blond beer√ïs bouquet is the result of a large array of floral and alcoholic esters which are complemented by a light and delicate fragrance of malts, fruit and hops. This medium-bodied beer has a fruity and delicately sweet flavour with a hint of alcohol. The aftertaste is a discrete display of hoppy bitterness. The Rigor Mortis are complex beers designed and brewed with patience and care in the tradition of the great Belgian Abbey beers.</description>
