  <name>KONIGSBERG</name>
  <description>Not very well known in America, Kellerbiers are very popular in Bavaria. Kellerbier, which means cellar beer in German, is a cask conditioned unfiltered lager. There is therefore very little effervescence and it is served by gravity, similar to the cask conditioned English ales.The K&#x9A;nigsberg (which means King&#xD5;s mountain or Mont Royal) is an amber beer, slightly cloudy, with malt and floral hop aromas. To the taste, the malt and roasted cereal flavours come through along with a sharp bitterness that is not overpowering. Konigsberg was brewed for the first time as the official beer of the 13th Mondial beer festival in Montreal.</description>
