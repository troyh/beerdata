  <description>The Alt is a classic German ale from the Dusseldorf region. It has dark copper colours which can be reminiscent of English Pale Ales. By using a different type of yeast, the aromas are less fruity and more neutral than a pale ale. The use of different types of malt also gives the beer a less caramel flavour than the English ales. To taste, the beer is mildly bitter and has fresh cereal flavours.</description>
