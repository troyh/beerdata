  <description>Our special Holiday brew, Ebenezer Ale is a smooth ale with a complex palate derived from four different roasted malts and a blend of local and imported hops. Deep mahogany in color, its malty first taste and full body is balanced with a light hop aroma, leading to a caramel finish. It's a festive elixir that can transform the mood of any scrooge! So forget the egg-nog and have a pint of Ebenezer.</description>
