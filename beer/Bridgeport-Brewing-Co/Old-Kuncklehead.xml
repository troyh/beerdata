  <description>A brewery tradition since 1989, BridgePort Old Knucklehead is a classic barley wine, brewed with double the amounts of malts and hops to create a beer that is audacious, malty, complex and full of character.  The sweetness and richness of this beer make it an excellent partner for a variety of desserts or as an after-dinner libation.</description>
