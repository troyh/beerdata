  <name>Black Strap Stout</name>
  <description>BridgePort Black Strap Stout features a malty, caramel flavor up front with a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish.  A generous dose of Northwest hops mingles with the sweetness of black strap molasses to yield a full-bodied ale that pours with beautiful cascade that settles to a rich, creamy head.</description>
