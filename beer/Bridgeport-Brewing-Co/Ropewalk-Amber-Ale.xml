  <description>Ropewalk is a mellow, malt-driven amber that dances a subtly sweet line. The balance of Crystal malt with a subtle dose of Northwest hops delivers a refreshing ale that makes for a great session beer. Originally brewed to mark our 20th anniversary, Ropewalk -- which literally means "a long narrow building where rope is made" -- is a tribute to our building's roots as a rope factory, while also celebrating feats of daring everywhere.</description>
