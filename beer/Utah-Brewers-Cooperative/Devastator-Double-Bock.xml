  <name>Devastator Double Bock</name>
  <description>The Devastator is a strong, amber lager (8% alcohol by volume). It has a fluffy white head with a bready malt aroma and a rich body that leaves you with a warming feeling. This Double Bock style dates back over a century when Monastic brewers knew it as "liquid bread."</description>
