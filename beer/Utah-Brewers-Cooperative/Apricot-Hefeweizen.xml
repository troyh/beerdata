  <name>Apricot Hefeweizen</name>
  <description>Possibly one of the most refreshing beers we've ever made. We start with a traditional German style unfiltered wheat beer (hefe-weizen translates literally as "yeasty wheat beer"). Brewed with a hybrid Bavarian yeast strain that imparts the defining flavor notes of licorice, clove, and banana. Add to this natural apricot flavor, and you have one astonishingly refreshing beer.</description>
