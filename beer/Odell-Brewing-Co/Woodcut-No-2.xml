  <description>Aged in virgin oak barrels, Woodcut No.2 is definitely a cut above.  The color is a rich golden copper.  Soft tannins complement the toffee-like malt character.  And the aromas are reminiscent of fresh woodshop shavings and vanilla bean -- an irresistible combination.  Each Woodcut offering is a truly lmited-edition beer made with select hops, fine malted barley and our brewers' careful aging process.</description>
