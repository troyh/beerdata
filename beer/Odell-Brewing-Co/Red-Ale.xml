  <description>The Rocky Mountain Goat is no ordinary goat. Just like Odell Red is no ordinary red. We took the American-style red to a whole new level by adding a variety of aggressive American hops--giving this ale a distinctive fresh hop aroma and flavor. We think you'll agree this red has some serious kick.</description>
