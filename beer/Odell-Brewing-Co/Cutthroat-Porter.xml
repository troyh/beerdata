  <description>Not quite a stout but definitely no lightweight, Cutthroat Porter is smooth and robust. Inspired by the classic London porters, we use dark roasted malts to create a deep, rich color and flavor that hint at chocolate and coffee. We named it Cutthroat Porter as our tribute to the Colorado state fish - with its own rich heritage and unmistakable dark coloring. And while we're big fans of small batches, here's to the currently threatened Cutthroat population reaching mass quantities.</description>
