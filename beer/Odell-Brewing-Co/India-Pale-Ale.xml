  <name>India Pale Ale</name>
  <description>We took the traditional IPA, originally shipped from England to India in the 1700's, and made it bolder and more flavorful - American Style. We've added new varieties of highly aromatic American hops to create a distinctive bitterness profile and an incredible hop character.</description>
