  <name>Old Plowshare Stout</name>
  <description>Old Plowshare is a full-flavored Celtic-style stout--smooth and firm-bodied with the bold flavor notes of dark roasted malts. Because Old Plowshare is organic, it remains true tithe time-honored Irish tradition of respect for natural ingredients. A great pub classic--or the perfect black for your Black and Tan.</description>
