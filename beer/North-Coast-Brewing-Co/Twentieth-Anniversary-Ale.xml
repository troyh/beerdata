  <name>Twentieth Anniversary Ale</name>
  <description>Anniversary XX is a continuation of our innovative approach to brewing over the past twenty years -- an approach that has included leading the way in the development of Belgian style beers, a barrel-aging program, the re-introduction of long-neglected imperial stout styles, and the new packaging ideas. We think it's a fitting crown for our first two decades of operation. XX is a unique beer, pale and lightly hopped, brewed with agave nectar and fermented with a special yeast strain. Some of the lots were aged in oak barrels and then blended to perfection so the final is a complex, subtle new direction in brewing art.</description>
