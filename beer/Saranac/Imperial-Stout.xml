  <description>Saranac Imperial Stout is part of our "High Peaks Series," a line of beers that are bigger, more complex and flavorful; beers that are meant to be sipped and savored. Saranac Imperial Stout is brewed with 11 malts to balance a deliciouse chocolate and coffee roasted flavor with a spicy herbal character of the generous kettle and dry hops.</description>
