  <description>Saranac Stout is the secret behind the success of our delicious Saranac Black &amp; Tan; It is lavishly brewed with seven unique malts and grains as well as a selection of memorable hops. Look for a full bodied taste and crescendo of complex flavor notes. This is a stout to remember and respect. Enjoy!</description>
