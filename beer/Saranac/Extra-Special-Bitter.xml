  <description>Bitters are popular pub beers in England and are closely related to the more well know Pale Ales. Saranac Extra Special Bitter has a rich, malty taste balanced by the pleasant bitterness of Williamette hops. The finish is dry with a hint of the floral English Fuggle and spicy Saaz hop. Enjoy!</description>
