  <description>Wholesome, delicious and refreshing. What more can you say about a beer brewed with generous amounts of American Wheat Malt. In keeping with the tradition of Dunkel Weizen, we've used a sweet addition of Cara and roast malts to add to the interest. Unfiltered so You'll experience the beer as wheat beers are meant to be enjoyed. </description>
