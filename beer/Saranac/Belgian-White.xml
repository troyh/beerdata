  <name>Belgian White</name>
  <description>Our Belgian Style White beer is smooth, tangy and very thirst quenching. Brewed with a delicate combination of oats, wheat and barley malt, we season it ever so lightly with hops. Then we add sprinklings of coriander and orange peel for a refreshing brew with a citrus aroma. Don't be fooled by the cloudy appearance, that's expected of a classic Belgian-style "Whitbier" or white beer.</description>
