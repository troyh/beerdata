  <name>Summer Ale</name>
  <description>With more than 2,800 bodies of water in the Adirondacks, it's not too hard to find a sunny place to relax, rest your feet and look out over the water. To celebrate summer in the Adirondacks, we've brewed a beer with generous amounts of wheat malt for a light, refreshing taste. Look for subtle hints of lemon.</description>
