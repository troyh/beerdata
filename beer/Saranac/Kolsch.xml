  <description>This golden sparkling blond ale was brewed to pay homage to a 1000-year tradition rooted in Cologne, Germany. Clear, crisp and easy to drink, the Kolsch of today is lighter than the "House" beer that was served in Cologne 200 years ago - the city that made Kolsch famous. We hope you'll enjoy it!</description>
