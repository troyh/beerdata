  <description>Winner of a Bronze Medal in the World Beer Cup, Blue Point's ESB is a traditional English style ale made with 2-row pale and English crystal malt. The malt of this full-bodied ale is balanced by copious amounts of English hops. Both Kent Goldings and Fuggles are used to impart a rich hop taste. Crack open a fresh jug of ESB, slice off a piece of tasty Gouda, sit back, and enjoy this unapologetic, mouth-puckering bitter handcrafted ale</description>
