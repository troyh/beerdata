  <name>Summer Ale</name>
  <description>Blue Point Brewing's Summer Ale has a delicious golden taste. In addition to traditional barley malt, a substantial portion of wheat malt is added to the mix giving this brew a unique tartness that's not found in many beers today. This light, thirst-quenching microbrew is enjoyed by all on a hot, Long Island Summer day.</description>
