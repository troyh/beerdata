  <name>Old Howling Bastard</name>
  <description>Blue Point Brewing's "Old Howling Bastard," named after an infamous local character, is a strong ale with plenty of character all its own. Made with English 2 row barley and Vienna malt. Reaching an alcohol content of 10%, barleywine should be consumed in moderation. Strong malty caramel flavors are balanced by lots and lots of hops. Try this in a snifter or wineglass. The trick is to never forget that after a few glasses you may become the "Old Howling Bastard."</description>
