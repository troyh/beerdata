  <description>A strong, silky smooth imperial stout with a deep, dark ruby appearance. Mocha, bitter chocolate, liquorice and dark cherry flavours prevail, before the balanced, warming and encapsulating finish.A contemporary Scottish take on an age old Russian classic style originally brewed for the Tsars. Our interpretation brings together hops from both sides of the Atlantic, amazing flavoured malts and dark sugars.Like the original BrewDog, this beer would never bite you but would much rather give you a lick on the face. Look Out! Serving Suggestion: Enjoy with an air of aristocratic nonchalance</description>
