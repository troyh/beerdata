  <name>Perseguidor</name>
  <description>A new sour blend chosen from select barrels to reflect our never ending pursuit and passion for perfection in every bottle. Cellared a further six months before being offered for sale. As always; unfiltered, unpasturized and naturally delicious. Not a single beer, but rather a journey into taste!</description>
