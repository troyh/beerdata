  <description>As with any good epic, herein lies the promise of larger-than-life experiences, heroics and twists &amp; turns as the adventure unfolds. These bottle-conditioned ales are specifically designed to be aged until sometime after December 12th, 2012. Provided you can wait that long. At that time, enjoy them in a "vertical" tasting. Each one unique to it's year of release. Each with its own "twist &amp; turn" in the plotline. Each one released one year, one month and one day from the previous year's edition. To remind you, the remaining dates are: 09.09.09, 10.10.10, 11.11.11., 12.12.12</description>
