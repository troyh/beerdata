  <description>Stone Old Guardian Barley Wine is a stunning representation of all that is big and bold in beer. This beautiful, bold barley wine has a massive malt character and a near-critical level of hop notes. Stone Old Guardian Barley wine can be enjoyed upon its release or cellared to enjoy in the future. </description>
