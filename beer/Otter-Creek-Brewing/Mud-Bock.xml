  <description>"We have had people contacting us for many years, asking when we will brew Mud Bock again," says Sales Manager Max Oswald. "It is almost like a cult following- people just did not forget about this beer. We decided the Otter should take a break from his world travels and focus on some styles closer to home."Mud Bock, for those who don't remember Otter Creek's spring seasonal offering from years back, is a hearty amber beer, with a perfect balance of malts and hops and herbal and floral notes. Available for a limited time only, in 22 oz bottles and on draft, Max advises all die-hard Mud Bock fans to "stock up while you can."</description>
