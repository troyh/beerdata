  <name>15th Anniversary IPA</name>
  <description>15 years ago, in a small rented warehouse in Middlebury, Vermont, we brewed our first batch of beer. Five years later, we built our own bigger and better brewery- and we've all been reaping the benefits ever since!\nTo celebrate our 15th anniversary Brewmaster Steve Parkes has brewed up a rich, bold and hoppy India Pale Ale. This IPA is dry hopped, a procedure that adds even more hop aroma to the already hoppy IPA style.</description>
