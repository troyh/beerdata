  <name>Vermont Lager</name>
  <description>A classic European style lager. We take the time to brew this beer as a true lager should be brewed. And it's well worth the wait! You can enjoy the drinkability of this light-gold, refreshing beer with friends at the pub or at home after a long day.</description>
