  <description>This time the Otter is going to Germany, with "Otterbahn," a weizenbock, set for May release. "Otterbahn" is a uniquecombination of a hefeweizen (unfiltered wheat beer), and a bock (robust malty ale). The wheat adds a citrus like flavor and light body, the unique yeast strain produces clove like character and banana esters. The addition of toasted malts adds even more complexity to this already full-flavored style. As they say in Germany- prosit!</description>
