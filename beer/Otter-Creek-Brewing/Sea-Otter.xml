  <description>"Sea Otter" Baltic Porter is full of deep roasted malt flavor with only a touch of hops. We used 2-row, Munich, Caramel, and special German hulled barley malt Carafa. Not only did we take extra time to brew this beer with a special "step mash" process, it was also fermented longer, with a lager yeast. The extra time and effort was well spent!</description>
