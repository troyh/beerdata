  <description>Pale Ale is agolden amber brew, made with Cascade hops from the Yakima Valley. Adding Cascades during conditioning captures the rich aroma of the hop, and completes the clean, well-balanced flavor of our American pale ale. Crisp, refreshing, exotically aromatic, and available all year.</description>
