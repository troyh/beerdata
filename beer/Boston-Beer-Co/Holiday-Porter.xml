  <name>Holiday Porter</name>
  <description>Introduced as a member of the Winter Classics Mix Pack in 2004, Samuel AdamsÂ® Holiday Porter with its rich malt complexity has become a favorite among our winter seasonal brews. In total, five varieties of malted barley are used in the brewing process including a variety of German malt called CarafaÂ®. The CarafaÂ® gives our Holiday Porter its smooth, roasted malt character. Add generous portions of imported hops to the mix and one has a brew that is both robust and high in drinkability.
CarafaÂ® is a registered trademark of Weyermann Malt, Bamburg, Germany.</description>
