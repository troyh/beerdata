  <description>Samuel AdamsÂ® Hefeweizen beer is a traditional spin on a classic American craft brewing style.  The brewers of Samuel AdamsÂ® used both malted and unmalted wheat, and two row Pale barley for a clean malty, cereal note.  This bright, fruity wheat ale is unfiltered, retaining a natural haze from malt proteins, crisp, bright flavors of wheat, and fresh, fruity ester complexity from our proprietary ale yeast. Accentuated with Noble Spalt-Spalter hops, Samuel AdamsÂ® Hefeweizen has an elegant and pleasant bitterness, finishing smooth and clean. Brewed with two row Harrington malt, wheat malt, and unmalted wheat.  It is also 100% unfiltered, leaving our ale yeast and its fruity fresh taste in place as well as a slight haze of proteins. These proteins are prone to settling out to the bottom of the bottle, so we recommend gently swirling this beer between sips, especially towards the bottom.</description>
