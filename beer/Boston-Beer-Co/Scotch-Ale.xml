  <name>Scotch Ale</name>
  <description>This is a brew for adventurous beer drinkers.  It is brewed with four malts: two row pale Harrington, Munich malt, chocolate malt, and a rare peat smoked malt commonly used by distillers of Scotch malt whiskey.  This unique malt gives Samuel AdamsÂ® Scotch Ale its distinct, subtle smoky character and deep amber hue. Samuel AdamsÂ® Scotch Ale is brewed using traditional English hops, Goldings and Fuggles. This is a big brew dominated by malt flavors and aromas, rich and full bodied, slightly sweet.  Its layered malt complexity lingers to a smooth and silky finish.</description>
