  <description>Sam Adams LightÂ® is not just a lighter version of our Samuel Adams Boston LagerÂ® but rather the culmination of over two years of tireless research and brewing trials to create a flavorful Light beer. And it has proved to be worth the wait. Brewed using only the finest two row malt and German Noble hops it has a smooth, complex roasted malt character that is superbly balanced with the subtle orange fruit notes of the Noble hops. Sam Adams LightÂ® finishes crisp and smooth without any lingering bitterness, leaving you yearning for more.</description>

  <ingredients>Sam Adams LightÂ® is brewed using only two row malted barley and the German Noble Hop Spalt-Spalter. Not cutting corners during the brewing process is key to the palate appeal of Sam Adams LightÂ®. A decoction mash as well as a secondary fermentation add time but also flavor.</ingredients>
