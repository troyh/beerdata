  <description>Named after the mythical beast that guards the gates of hell... Kerberos is a traditional Belgian-style Tripel with a dark golden color &amp; has a sweet flavor with a dry and spicy finish. This nectar of the Gods is deceptively strong at 8.5% and is bottle conditioned for an authentic flavor.</description>
