  <name>Double Dog Double Pale Ale</name>
  <description>Back by popular demand, our original "Wild Dog Release" is back, and this time it's for good. Double Dog Double Pale Ale is a generously hopped ale with a deep red color and pours with a nice frothy head. The abundance of hops will conjure some provocative aromas with hints of raisins and citrus.</description>
