  <name>UBU Ale</name>
  <description>The mountain village of Lake Placid was once home to a legendary chocolate lab named Ubu, the biggest dog you've ever seen with an uncanny nose for great beer. Deep garnet red in color, this English-Style Ale is a tribute to the legend of Ubu. It features a smooth, rich maltiness complemented by just the right amount of hops. Here's to the legend!</description>
