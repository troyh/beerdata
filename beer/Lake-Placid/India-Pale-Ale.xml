  <name>India Pale Ale</name>
  <description>Lake Placid IPA is deep copper in color and brimming with hops from the first sniff to the final taste, balanced by just a touch of malty sweetness. Originally brewed as a winter seasonal, it quickly earned a place in our permanent line-up and is our most award-winning brew. Here's to hops!</description>
