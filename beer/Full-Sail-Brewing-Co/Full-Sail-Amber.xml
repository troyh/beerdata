  <description>Anyone remember the grocery store cooler back before it turned into a kaleidoscopic fantasy world of beer options? You pretty much had two choices: Regular or Light. In 1989, when we brewed our first batch of Full Sail Amber, not only was it the first Amber ale here in Beer Mecca (aka Oregon) -- it was the first craft beer to go into a bottle. And two things became immediately apparent. It wasn't Regular and it sure as heck wasn't Light. Our Amber is a sweet, malty, medium-bodied ale with a spicy, floral hop finish. </description>
