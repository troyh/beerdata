  <description>LTD means Limited Edition. But around here it means something even more: Live The Dream. And in celebration of our 21st birthday we're doing something every brewer dreams of: Concocting an ever-changing series of small batch beers, available for a limited time only. Each new LTD Series brew will showcase an original lager recipe, pimped out by our ace crew of libationary wunderkinds.</description>
