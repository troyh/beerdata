  <name>Brewmaster's Reserve: Old Boardhead Barleywine Ale</name>
  <description>A deliciously rich Barleywine that has a spectacular depth &amp; delicacy of flavor that is deep &amp; robust. Its strong sweet body is balanced with Centennial &amp;  Crystal hops for a pleasant hoppiness &amp; finish. Makes a great cellar beer.</description>
