  <name>Full Sail IPA</name>
  <description>The British colonists who oncevisited India invented India Pale Ale. But we seriously doubt they ever enjoyed one after a day of fullblown kiteboarding. What a shame. Generously hopped to 60 IBU's in the classic style, our IPA is a real thirst quencher. t has a full, malty body and there's even a hint of fresh citrus to it. Perfect after your favorite water sport. Even if that happens to be the grueling drag-the-poolside-lounge-chair-into-the-sun event.</description>
