  <name>Knight Rider Black IPA</name>
  <description>A glimpse into the future?Â  Perhaps.Â  A tasty beer nonetheless that combines the best attributes of a dark beer (roast and chocolate notes) with your favorite NW ingredient: hops (at 2.5# per barrel)!Â  Hop bitterness combines with the complexities of dark malts, yet finishes incredibly clean...unlike the KITT car, this beer is not programmed to accept voice commands.</description>
