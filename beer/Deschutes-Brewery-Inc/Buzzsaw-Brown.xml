  <name>Buzzsaw Brown</name>
  <description>By 1915, Bend, Oregon, was alive with the sound of the buzz saw, as two of the country's largest pine sawmills set up shop on the banks of the Deschutes River. The mills are gone now, but the smokestacks still stand testament to Bend's humble beginnings. â¨â¨Buzzsaw Brown is an easy-drinking beer that is refreshing after a hard dayâs work. The timber mills in Bend may be closed, but whether your adventure includes a day of scaling rock faces, hitting 18 holes or skiing the slopes in spring, Buzzsaw Brown is the perfect end to a fun-filled day. â¨â¨âBuzzsaw Brown is one of my favorite beers,â says Deschutes Brewery Brewmaster Larry Sidor. âThe unique combination of European and American malts makes it a very food friendly beer that pairs well with a wide variety of flavors.â</description>
