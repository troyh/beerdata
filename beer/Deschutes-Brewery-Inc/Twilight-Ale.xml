  <name>Twilight Ale</name>
  <description>Stretching the longer summer days into Twilight! There is something magical about the time of day that falls between light and dark, the high-desert summer day fading into a warm evening with brilliant skies. â¨â¨Twilight Ale is a lighter, but full flavored ale with a balanced malt profile and a harmonious blend of four hops. A final dry hopping of bold Amarillos creates the distinctive finishing touch. Twilight is best enjoyed when chilled and consumed outdoors.</description>
