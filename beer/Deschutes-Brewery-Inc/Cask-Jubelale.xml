  <description>Did you know that Jubelale was the first beer ever bottled by Deschutes Brewery? Every year, fallâs crisp, cool air signals the imminent arrival of winter. Thoughts of snow, friends and family, the holidays, and â Jubelale. Brewed with dark crystal malt creating a luscious holiday note with bountiful hops to excite your taste budsâ itâs easy to see why Jubelale is the perfect complement to the season.â¨â¨Every year Deschutes Brewery selects a Northwest artist to create an image evocative of the seasonâs festive atmosphere. In 2008, Pam Jersey Bird, who lives in Sisters, painted a winding, abstract river running through the open spaces of Central Oregonâs desert, surrounded by fluttering snowfall.â¨â¨âBecause Jubelale is 'A Festive Winter Ale,' I wanted to portray a scene that was lively and colorful but also captured Central Oregonâs snowy climate,â says Pam Jersey Bird. âI decided to focus on the river that is the namesake of the brewery and also inspired the name of our town. Emphasizing the curve of the bank, I added snowflakes and ice crystals, which surround the blue moving waters of the Deschutes River.â More of Pam's work can be viewed at www.pamjerseybird.com.Â  </description>
