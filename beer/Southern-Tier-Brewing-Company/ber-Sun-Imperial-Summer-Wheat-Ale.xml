  <name>ber sun Imperial Summer Wheat Ale</name>
  <description>It is through the movement of the universe that life presents itself in transformation. It is in this spirit that we make berSun, a tribute to the dynamic energy of summer. The alignment of wheat and barley through this hop-infused brew embodies the solar system itself... This may be a difficult task, but one our brewers revel in! They brew a galaxy of taste into every batch. berSun is the ultimate experience that will challenge you with each sip. berSun Imperial Summer Wheat Beer takes off where our Hop Sun finishes. Like itÕs little brother, berSun is clean and full of flavor, but donÕt pull an IcarusÐ this is one big beer! Pour a glass or drink straight from the bottle, itÕs meant to be consumed wisely with friends between summer solstice and autumnal equniox.</description>
