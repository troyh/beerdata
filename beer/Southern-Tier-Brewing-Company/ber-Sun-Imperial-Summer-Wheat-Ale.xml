  <name>&#x9F;ber sun Imperial Summer Wheat Ale</name>
  <description>It is through the movement of the universe that life presents itself in transformation. It is in this spirit that we make &#x86;berSun, a tribute to the dynamic energy of summer. The alignment of wheat and barley through this hop-infused brew embodies the solar system itself... This may be a difficult task, but one our brewers revel in! They brew a galaxy of taste into every batch. &#x86;berSun is the ultimate experience that will challenge you with each sip. &#x86;berSun Imperial Summer Wheat Beer takes off where our Hop Sun finishes. Like it&#xD5;s little brother, &#x86;berSun is clean and full of flavor, but don&#xD5;t pull an Icarus&#xD0; this is one big beer! Pour a glass or drink straight from the bottle, it&#xD5;s meant to be consumed wisely with friends between summer solstice and autumnal equniox.</description>
