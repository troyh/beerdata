  <description>High in the winter sky, two parallel stick figures are visible &amp; known as "the twins," or the constellation Gemini. The astronauts of the 1960s flew as teams of two in a program named after the celestial pairing. At Southern Tier, we have our own fraternal twins, Hoppe &amp; Unearthly. Blended together &amp; placed in this vessel, the mission of our Gemini is to travel high &amp; take passengers on a journey far into the heavens.</description>
