  <name>Trout Slayer Ale</name>
  <description>They say the best way to shrink a fish is with with a ruler, but the best way to grow a fish is with a beer. Montana Trout Slayer is the beer to drink when you're knockin' back a couple cold ones and tellin' fish stories. Who knows the next one might be the best yet! "A bigger tale with every ale." Trout Slayer is a filtered wheat ale, fermented at cool temperatures, making it a smooth drinkable session beer</description>
