  <description>Don't blame yourself, you can blame us. Scape Goat is about to become your favorite beer. Or it will be when you taste it. Scape Goat is our award-winning Pale Ale. It is a very smooth brew, refreshing and well-balanced. Scape Goat took home the Gold Medal from the North American Brewers' Association competitions as the best English-style pale ale brewed west of the Mississippi, but only because it is the best. </description>
