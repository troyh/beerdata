  <description>Willy, named after my brother-in-law's childhood nickname, is crisp and light-bodied, with a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. The hopping is mild and gentle. It's perfect for times when you crave a beer utterly refreshing and low in alcohol. A true thirst quencher everyone enjoys.</description>
