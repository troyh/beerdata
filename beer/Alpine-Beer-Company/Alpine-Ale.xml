  <name>Alpine Ale</name>
  <description>Our namesake ale represents everything a good, well balanced pale ale should be: malty but not to sweet, refreshing but not too bitter, full-bodied but not too heavy, lively but not over carbonated. A clean, everyday beer that leaves your palate begging for more.</description>
