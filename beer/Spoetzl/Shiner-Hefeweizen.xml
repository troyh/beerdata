  <name>Shiner Hefeweizen</name>
  <description>Hefeweizen (Hef-ay-vite-zen) recalls the classic beers of Bavaria as a true unfiltered wheat brew. This beer captures old-world Munich Malt, wheat grist used in a scant 1% of all brews worldwide, orange and lemon zest in a frothy classic example of bottle-conditioned beer. Adding clover honey and yeast just before it'?s bottled touches off a unique, secondary fermentation process inside every keg and bottle before its final release from the brewery.</description>
