  <description>Our most popular beer, M&#x8A;rzen is a smooth, mildly sweet, auburn colored lager. This beer originates from Bavaria where it was brewed in March ("M&#x8A;rzen" in German) and stored in caves to be enjoyed during warmer weather. At the end of September, any remaining kegs of M&#x8A;rzen were consumed during the two week celebration which became known as Oktoberfest.</description>
