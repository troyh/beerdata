  <description>Our most popular beer, Mrzen is a smooth, mildly sweet, auburn colored lager. This beer originates from Bavaria where it was brewed in March ("Mrzen" in German) and stored in caves to be enjoyed during warmer weather. At the end of September, any remaining kegs of Mrzen were consumed during the two week celebration which became known as Oktoberfest.</description>
