  <description>Pilsner is a crisp, golden, highly hopped lager. This beer was first brewed in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia in 1842 using a sample of special yeast smuggled from Germany by a Czech monk. Until this time all beers were dark and cloudy. The new Czech Pilsner was the first beer to be brewed clear and golden.</description>
