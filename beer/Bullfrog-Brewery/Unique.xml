  <description>Often in Trappist breweries the monks brew a beer of low alcohol strength for the brothers to consume... so I just had to put my spin on this Trappist-inspired Singel. Brewed with imported malts, a Trappist yeast strain, American Palisade, Willamette and Crystal hops plus a slew of wild yeast in the bottle for a refreshingly tart snap. This beer truely is Unique!</description>
