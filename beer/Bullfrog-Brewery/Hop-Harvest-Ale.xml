  <name>Hop Harvest Ale</name>
  <description>A truely American original, this beer starts out as a straightforward E.S.B. and is then transformed with a huge dose of sticky, wet hops fresh from the Yakima Valley. This year I used a blend of Simcoe and Chinook hops at a whopping rate of 4.3 pounds per barrel suspended right in the serving tank so as it's served more of their goodness oozes out! Yes it's true...I LOVE HOPS!</description>
