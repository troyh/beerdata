  <name>Blue Collar Brown </name>
  <description>This cask-conditioned session ale has a luscious brown body and is lavashly hopped with American grown Centennial hops. Blue Collar Brown is a salute to Williamsports working men and women, rich in flavor but low in alcohol. Served from our 45 degree cask room via handpump.</description>
