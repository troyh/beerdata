  <name>North Star Premium Lager</name>
  <description>A light straw-colored Premium Lager. Brewed with Pilsen malt for a hint of honey flavor and a light body. Sterling and Perle hops provide the crisp refreshing finish. A great introduction to craft brewed lagers. Great with salads and lighter flavored fare.</description>
