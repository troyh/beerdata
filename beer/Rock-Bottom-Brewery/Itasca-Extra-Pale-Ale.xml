  <description>The Brewer's favorite! A copper-hued American Pale Ale. Brewed with Pale Ale and Crystal malts for a medium-bodied caramel flavor. Generously hopped with four varities for an orange-grapefruit flavor and aroma. This is the choice for hopheads! Pairs well with pizzas and our Certified Angus Beef Burgers.</description>
