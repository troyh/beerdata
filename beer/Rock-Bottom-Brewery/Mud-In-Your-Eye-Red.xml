  <name>Mud in your Eye Red</name>
  <description>This medium-bodied beer is made with a variety of Belgian and English caramel malts to produce a deep ruby red color. Imported hops lend a noticeable spicy aroma to this "classic" red ale. Our signature hearthstone pizzas taste great with this red ale.</description>
