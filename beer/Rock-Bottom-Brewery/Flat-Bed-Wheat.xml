  <description>We'll brew a variety of wheat beers including the Bavarian Hefeweizen with hints of banana and clove; the Belgian Wit spiced with orange peel and coriander; and teh American Wheat flavored with ginger. Any of our fine selections of sandwiches will get along wonderfully with wheat beer.</description>
