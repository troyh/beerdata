  <name>Mother Martha's Kolsch-style Ale</name>
  <description>Brewed in the Menninger family tradition, this light bodied ale is lagered to create a highly refreshing beer with a subtle fruitiness in the nose and a soft palate. German Perle and Tettnang hops provide a subdued spicy balance that makes this beer a perfect match for salads and burgers. Awarded GOLD at the 2004 World Beer Cup in the German-Style Kolsch Category.</description>
