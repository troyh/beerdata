  <name>Snowshoe Red Ale</name>
  <description>Settle in with Wisconsin's Snowshoe Ale. This beer is brewed with a blend of American and German malts. A complicated decoction mash process ensures a rich malty flavor. We also infuse generous amounts of Yakima Golding and Bavarian Hallertau Hops to add a special note of warmth for your winter evening's enjoyment. \nExpect this beer to be a beautiful copper-red, with a fruity ale body and a spiced hop finish. Then sit back and rejoice in the season because it's these Wisconsin winters that keep the whiners out.</description>
