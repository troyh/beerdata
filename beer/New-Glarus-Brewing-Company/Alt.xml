  <description>Saluting our continued survival on this planet we decided to go all out with New Glarus ALT. The Brilliant bronze body was cultivated in a three hour kettle boil of Caramel malts and Raw Turbinado Sugar. Aged in Oak in open top fermentors followed by a second round of bottle conditioning. \nA firm head of foam sweeps brisk hop notes of Syrian Golding and German Hallertau to your nose. A defiant anomaly tenacious and independent this is a flavor experience to relish.</description>
