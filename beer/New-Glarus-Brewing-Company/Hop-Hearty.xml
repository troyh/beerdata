  <description>Finally, Hop Hearty Ale, the Wisconsin I.P.A. you've been thirsten' for. This ale is brewed with the best of Old and New World Hops. Then we infuse the aging tanks with a dry hop addition of Cascade and East Kent Goldings to bring home the hops! \nExpect this ale to pour a glass brimming with rich caramel flavors along with an intense hop aroma that you won't soon forget. Cleanly bitter and aromatic, this ale is not for the faint of heart.</description>
