  <name>Unplugged Enigma</name>
  <description>A complex and intriguing original. The mystery began with wild yeast spontaneously fermenting a rich of treasure of malted barley and whole cherries. Unlined Oak casks breathe deep vanilla hues and chords of smoke into this sour brown ale. Our Master Brewer has forged a smooth garnet tapestry that defies description. Wander off the beaten path.</description>
