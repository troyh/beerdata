  <description>Third in our "Unplugged" series is a Belgian Style Triple. This beer is handcrafted in the Monastic tradition and bottle fermented for a slightly dry finish. The incredibly complex layers of fruit and spice tones will sing on your palette. Those born with saintly patience might lay this beer down for a year or more, the rest of us will enjoy the bold smoothness of this Triple today.</description>
