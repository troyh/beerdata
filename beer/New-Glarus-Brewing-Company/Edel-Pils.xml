  <description>Our little village brewery in New Glarus, Wisconsin is proud to offer to you Edel-Pils. This "Noble-Pilsner" is the creation of our brewmaster. He brought special yeast from Bavaria, combined it with Wisconsin barley and the finest Bavarian and American hops. Then employing traditional brewing methods, this Pilsner is finished with a long cold rest in our cellars. \nExpect this bier to be creamy and full-bodied with a smooth finish. It will complement any fine meal or friendly gathering. We took our time in brewing so that you might take your time enjoying</description>
