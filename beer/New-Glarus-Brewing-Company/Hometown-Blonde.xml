  <description>Embrace a classic! Hometown Blonde is an Old World style pilsner, assertively hopped with four premium hop varieties. Tettnanger, Saaz, Styrian Golding and Strisselpalt varieties all grace this German-style brew with the complex character you enjoy in a classic pilsner. \nExpect to pour an elegant blonde glass of beer, crowned with a rich head of foam that resonates with our chorus of hops. Although delicate in appearance, our Hometown Blonde has a backbone, but of course in Wisconsin that is no surprise.</description>
