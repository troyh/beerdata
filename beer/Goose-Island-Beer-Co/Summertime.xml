  <description>The color of sunshine, with a light fruity aroma and a hint of fruity acidity, Goose Island Summertime is the perfect summer session ale. A K&#x9A;lsch beer brewed in the traditional German fashion, you&#xD5;ll find yourself enjoying and savoring each sip of summertime as much as you do those hot summer days and cool summer nights.</description>
