  <name>Double Stout</name>
  <description>Golden naked oats mashed with dark crystal and robust roasted malts create a luscious black brew with satin smooth finish. Layering UK Target hops throughout the boil adds pleasant, earthy complexity while higher fermentation temperatures enhance overall flavor with fruity esters. An old-world style, done the Green Flash way. Big, bold, flavorful and complex.</description>
