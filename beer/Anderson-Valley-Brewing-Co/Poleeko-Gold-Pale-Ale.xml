  <name>Poleeko Gold Pale Ale</name>
  <description>When the phrase "California Style Ale" is used, Poleeko Gold Pale Ale is the one that comes to mind. The golden color and generous use of Pacific Northwest hops establish a distinct style, separate from any domestic or European beers. Our honey-gold pale ale is crisp and clear, with an unusual lightness and dryness for such a full-flavored ale. The arousing abundance of hops adds both a floral bouquet and a lively, citrusy finish. It is excellent alone, or with full-flavored meals and spicy dishes.</description>
