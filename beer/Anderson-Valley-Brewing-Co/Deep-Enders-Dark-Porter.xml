  <name>Deep Enders Dark Porter</name>
  <description>What was once a dying beer style in England has been revived as an American classic. Deep Enders Dark Porter is a full-bodied porter with a rich creamy head, delicious chocolaty aftertaste and a roasted coffee character. A pleasantly bitter brew, Deep Enders is excellent with oysters and other shellfish, smoked duck, and Chateaubriand, as well as your favorite chocolate desserts or with full-flavored meals and spicy dishes.</description>
