  <name>Hop Ottin' IPA</name>
  <description>Hop Ottin' IPA is as hoppy as they come. The name means "hard working hops," in Boontling, and that tells it all. Generous additions of high-alpha Pacific Northwest hops added during a vigorous boil, plus traditional dry hopping, with whole hop cones, give this ale a delicious citrus aroma, and an intense hoppy bite. This IPA is a hop lover's dream.</description>
