  <name>Old Whiskers Hefeweizen</name>
  <description>This is our perennial summer seasonal beer, first brewed in Summer 1995 when we opened.Affectionately called "Spunky and Chunky", Old Whiskers Hefeweizen is a traditional Bavarian-style unfiltered wheat beer. Created with equal parts malted wheat and pale two-row malt, Old Whiskers is lightly hopped to style. A unique Bavarian strain of yeast imparts a clove- or banana-like aroma and flavor. (We swear we did not put cloves into the brew. It is the magical powers of The Yeast.) Old Whisker is delicious and refeshing--the perfect summer quencher, served with or without a slice of lemon.</description>
