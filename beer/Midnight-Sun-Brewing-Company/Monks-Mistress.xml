  <description>Dark and strong as the style implies, La Maitresse du Moine dances across the palate with complexity and mystery--just as the Northern Lights move across the night sky, delighting the senses and enlightening the mind. In the tradition of monks who have devoutly brewed beers of character and strength for centuries, La Maitresse du Moine Dark Strong Ale reflects the passion and dedication required to create a beer this heavenly. This Mistress of the Monk is seductive, pensive and intriguing. We say it in French: La Maitresse du Moine.</description>
