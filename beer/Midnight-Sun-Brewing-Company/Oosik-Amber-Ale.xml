  <description>Oosik Amber Ale is a true German-style altbier, brewed with pale, Munich and crystal malts. Deep amber with copper highlights, Oosik sports a toasted and caramel malt profile, balanced by traditional noble hops. A special yeast strain ferments this ale at cooler lager temperatures, giving it a smooth malt character and a clean finish. Want to hang--so to speak--for a while? Oosik Amber Ale gives you hang time. Great flavor, big mouthfeel, satisfying finish...all in a session-worthy beer. Compare it to other ambers--Oosik rules. Look for our 20-inch Oosik tap in better beer bars throughout AK.</description>
