  <description>Full Curl Scotch Ale is brewed in the traditional Wee Heavy Scotch strong ale style. (This is not to be confused with the lighter-bodied Scottish ale style.) All about malt, Full Curl pours dark brown with a tan head. Its medium body provides sustenance while its strength boosts courage. With a stiff mug of Full Curl under your belt, you may even have what it takes to don a kilt.</description>
