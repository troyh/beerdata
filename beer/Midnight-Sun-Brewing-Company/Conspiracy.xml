  <description>Conspiracy Belgian-style Black Beer is the result of a collaboration between Midnight Sun brewers Gabe Fletcher and Ben Johnson and Pelican Pub (Pacific City, OR) brewer Ben Love. These brewers conspired during barley wine fest week to brew up a deviously delicious dark Belgian-style beer. Conspiracy is opaque black with a creamy beige head. Black malt shrouds it in mystery; the Belgian yeast imparts intriguing flavor; the alcohol adds danger. If you're up for this mission, watch your back.</description>
