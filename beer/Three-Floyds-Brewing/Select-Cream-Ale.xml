  <name>Select Cream Ale</name>
  <description>Our Cream Ale is slightly different than most other beers of this style because ours is a little darker. We did this to make it a more flavorful beer since most other cream ales are fairly bland. We used pale malt and some light colored caramel malts to give the beer a deep golden color. These malts also give the beer a full bodied malt character. We used North American, German and English hops to give the beer a distinct hop flavor and aroma. The result is a bold and flavorful ale that can be enjoyed in the spring and summer.</description>
