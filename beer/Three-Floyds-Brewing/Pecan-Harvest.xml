  <description>Pecan Harvest Ale is made with real Louisiana pecans that have been toasted to perfection. That makes it something really special, because most beers with a nutty flavor or aroma aren't made with real nuts. The natural oils from the Louisiana pecans give the ale a light pecan finish and aroma. \nThis ale is excellent served with both red meat, seafood, gouda cheese, and no surprise here, it's also great with nuts!
