  <name>Select Belgian Golden Ale</name>
  <description>Our Belgian Golden Ale is made exclusively with pale malts, resulting in a deep golden color and sweet malty taste. It is a flavorful brew (7.5% ABV), but is hopped liberally with German hops to balance out the sweetness and strength. We selected a special Belgian yeast strain that slightly imparts the flavors of banana, clove and even bubble gum. The result is a unique, and flavorful ale.</description>
