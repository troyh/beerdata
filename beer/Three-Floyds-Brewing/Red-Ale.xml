  <description>Red Ale (March -- May) is brewed with British pale and crystal malts, Sterling hops, and an ale yeast from California. This ale has a rich ruby color, lacy collar, and a pronounced caramel flavor. Try it with traditional Irish fare or a sweet and pleasant cow's milk cheese called Dubliner that can be found in most grocery stores.</description>
