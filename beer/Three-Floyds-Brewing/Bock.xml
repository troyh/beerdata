  <name>Bock</name>
  <description>Bock (January &#xD0; March) is the first of our seasonal brews. It is brewed with Perle hops and pale and caramel malts. Our Bock is similar to a German Maibock in its high malt content, full body and slightly higher alcohol content. Abita Bock is a very popular brew, especially during our Mardi Gras season. Gruy&#x8E;re, Emmental and Swiss are nice cheese choices with Bock. Great with roasted beef or pork. Try it with Mexican food too.</description>
