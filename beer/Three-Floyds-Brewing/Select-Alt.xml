  <name>Select Alt</name>
  <description>Our Alt is very similar to the commercially produced alt beers that are made in D&#x9F;sseldorf today. It is made with all German Weyermann malts and is hopped and dry hopped with German Tettnanger hops. This is going to give the beer a very malty character and a pleasant hop aroma and flavor. The result is an aromatic light colored brown ale with a rich malty taste.</description>
