  <description>Our Alt is very similar to the commercially produced alt beers that are made in DÂŸsseldorf today. It is made with all German Weyermann malts and is hopped and dry hopped with German Tettnanger hops. This is going to give the beer a very malty character and a pleasant hop aroma and flavor. The result is an aromatic light colored brown ale with a rich malty taste.</description>
