  <description>Our English IPA is made with British pale and light crystal malts. It gives the beer a bright pale color and malty flavor. It also produces a very intense taste. It is hopped liberally with English Kent Golding Hops. This results in the beer having a pleasant bitter taste and fruity hops aroma. The extra bitterness will mix with the strong sweet flavor from the malt for a very balanced tasting beer. The result is a very bold and flavorful pale ale.</description>
