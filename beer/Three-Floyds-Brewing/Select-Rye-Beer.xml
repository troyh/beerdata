  <name>Select Rye Beer</name>
  <description>Our Rye beer is made with rye, pale and victory malts. To create a bold flavor, we use more rye than in most rye beers. The ratio is 40% rye, 40% pale and 20% victory malts. The victory malt gives the beer the pleasing aroma of freshly baked bread and is a perfect compliment to the rye malt. The beer is hopped with American hop varieties without a trace of bitterness, allowing the full rye flavor to come through. The result is a light brown, full flavored, malty beer.</description>
