Anchor Brewing,Anchor Steam,,,"San Francisco's famous Anchor Steam, the classic of American brewing tradition since 1896, is virtually handmade, with an exceptional respect for the ancient art of brewing. The deep amber color, thick creamy head, and rich flavor all testify to our traditional brewing methods. Anchor Steam is unique, for our brewing process has evolved over many decades and is like no other in the world.Anchor Steam derives its unusual name from the 19th century when ""steam"" seems to have been a nickname for beer brewed on the West Coast of America under primitive conditions and without ice. The brewing methods of those days are a mystery and, although there are many theories, no one can say with certainty why the word ""steam"" came to be associated with beer. For many decades Anchor alone has used this quaint name for its unique beer. In modern times, ""Steam"" has become a trademark of Anchor Brewing.",,4.9,,,,,,,,,2-Row Barley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anchor Brewing,Liberty Ale,,Ale,"First introduced in 1975, Liberty Ale is brewed strictly according to traditional brewing methods, and, like all Anchor Brewing Company products, uses only natural ingredients -- water, malted barley, fresh whole hops and yeast. A special top-fermenting ale yeast is used during fermentation and is responsible for many of Liberty Ale's subtle flavors and characteristics. Carbonation is produced by an entirely natural process called ""bunging,"" which produces champagne-like bubbles. Dry-hopping (adding fresh hops to the brew during aging), imparts a unique aroma to the ale. It is a process rarely used in this country today.",,6,,,,,,,,,2-Row Barley,Top-fermenting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anchor Brewing,Anchor Porter,,Porter,"Anchor Porter is a unique dark brew, which was introduced by Anchor in the early 1970s. Anchor Porter, like all of Anchor Brewing Company's products, is brewed with only natural ingredients. Specially roasted dark malts are used, along with atop-fermenting yeast. The brew is hopped at a very high rate, and is naturally carbonated to produce an intensely rich flavor and thick creamy head. \nThe rich flavor of Anchor Porter has earned this delicious and unique brew a worldwide reputation for outstanding quality. \nWe use specially roasted malts, a top-fermenting yeast, and only fresh whole hops, which are added liberally. All this combines to produce a rich and intense flavor with subtle notes of chocolate, toffee, and coffee. ",,5.6,,,,,,,,,2-Row Barley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anchor Brewing,Anchor Summer,,American Wheat,"Anchor Summer is the first American wheat beer in modern times. Our first brew of this light and refreshing beer was in the summer of 1984. Anchor Summer is an all-malt beer, and over 50% of its malt comes from malted wheat. It is fermented with a traditional top-fermenting ""ale"" yeast because we prefer the clean flavors developed by this yeast. We believe that this style best celebrates the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. You may notice that the head on this beer is unusually abundant, with a consistency similar to whipped egg whites. This is due to protein contributed by the wheat. \nThe brewers at Anchor are proud to have revived not only rich hearty dark beers, but also this light crisp style of a modern American wheat beer. \nWheat malt contributes to an unusual lightness and dryness to the palate, and this--combined with the distinctive flavor of the wheat--makes for a perfect thirst-quenching beverage. It is the ideal drink for beer lovers who appreciate tradition and character in their beer, but also seek a lighter, refreshing style, perfect for warm weather.",,4.6,,,,Summer,,,,Wheat/2-Row Barley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anchor Brewing,Old Foghorn Ale,,Barleywine Ale,"Old Foghorn Barleywine Style Ale is brewed strictly according to traditional brewing methods, using only natural ingredients -- water, malted barley, fresh whole hops, and yeast. Old Foghorn is based on traditional English barley wines.\nOld Foghorn is highly hopped, using only Cascade hops. It is fermented with a true top-fermenting ale yeast. Carbonation is produced by an entirely natural process called ""bunging,"" which produces champagne-like bubbles. Our ""barleywine ale"" is dry-hopped with additional Cascade hops while it ages in our cellars.\nWe have been producing small batches of Old Foghorn since 1975. Today, it is available both on draught and in twelve-ounce bottles. The high original gravity and full flavor of this ale make it a unique product, perfect for sipping after dinner.\nA lot of time and tradition goes into our Old Foghorn, and we hope you will enjoy it as much as we do. Because of the high original gravity, the yeast is unable to ferment all of the sugars. As a result, barley wine is high in alcohol, and is slightly sweet, due to the residual sugars. Old Foghorn also has a pleasant hop bitterness, due to the large quantity of hops used during brewing, and a unique hop aroma due to the dry-hopping and aging.\nThe original gravity of our barley wine is so high because only the very first running of the mash is used. Therefore, three mashes are required to produce one barley wine brew, making it very costly to produce.",,8 to 10,,,,,,,,2-Row Barley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anchor Brewing,Anchor Small,,Ale,"The tradition of brewing two distinct beers from one mash has existed for thousands of years, and for centuries the term ""small beer"" was used in English to describe the lighter and weaker second beer. By association, the term came to mean something of little importance. \nWe make our Old Foghorn Barleywine Style Ale from the rich first runnings of an all-malt mash, and Anchor Small Beer is our attempt to duplicate the ""small beers"" of old by sparging that same mash: sprinkling warm water over the Old Foghorn mash after the first wort has run off, thereby creating a second, lighter brew from the resulting thinner wort. Technically, both beers are ""ales"" because they are made with top-fermenting yeast.\nWe believe you will find Anchor Small Beer delicious--similar to what modern brewers call a ""bitter""--and we hope you will also enjoy the idea of reviving an ancient brewing tradition, which is something of great importance. When we initially attempted Small Beer, we quickly realized we had a lot to learn: How much to sparge? What gravity to look for? What sort of hopping to employ? But, from the beginning, we were astonished to find that the ""small beer"" we were making certainly was not small beer in the linguistic sense--it was good, it was rich, it was wonderful ale! We hope our loyal customers will agree this is a tradition worth reviving.",,3.3,,,,,,,,2-Row Barley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anchor Brewing,Christmas Ale ,,Ae,"The brewers of Anchor Steam Beer are proud to announce the release of our thirty-fourth annual Christmas Ale.\nEvery year since 1975 the brewers at Anchor have brewed a distinctive and unique Christmas Ale, which is available from early November to mid-January. The Ale's recipe is different every year--as is the tree on the label--but the intent with which we offer it remains the same: joy and celebration of the newness of life. Since ancient times, trees have symbolized the winter solstice when the earth, with its seasons, appears born anew. Each year our Christmas Ale gets a unique label and a unique recipe for the Ale itself. Although our recipes must remain a secret, many enthusiasts save a few bottles from year to year--stored in a cool dark place--to taste later and compare with other vintages. Properly refrigerated, the beer remains intriguing and drinkable for years, with different nuances slowly emerging as the flavor mellows slightly.",,Varies,,,,Winter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dieu du ciel,Solstice d'hiver,,Barley wine,"This noble winter beer is brown in colour with flaming red highlights. Its taste is delicately sweet and liquor-like with a hint of burnt caramel coming from the malt and a prolonged boiling time. It is a very bitter beer with aromas of hops and alcohol, and flavours reminiscent of red fruit brought by the English-type yeast we use to ferment it. The aftertaste is accentuated by the wonderful flavour of hops. Solstice d'Hiver is brewed only once a year, and is then aged for 4 to 5 months before being sold.

It was created by Dieu du Ciel specifically for the 14th annual Mondial beer festival in Montreal. It is actually a hybrid between an Irish Cream Ale and an Imperial Pale Ale (or Double IPA). The beer is an amber ale with strong flavours of caramel malt as well as a fruity taste typically produced with English yeast. The Imperial side of the coin makes it boldly bitter, both in aroma and taste, due in part to the dry hopping as well as the high alcohol content (9%). The presence of the alcohol, although discrete, brings out the other flavours to make it a complex and full bodied beer, without loosing any of its balance. Like a true Irish Cream Ale, it is conditioned with a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, giving it less effervescence but a smooth, long lasting head.",,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spices come through immediately, giving very little room for the usual wheat beer aromas (coriander and curaçao). Cinnamon and clove dominate and the flavours are generously well-rounded thanks no doubt to residual sugars.

This beer is usually dry hopped, a tradition that is adhered to by Dieu du Ciel!. The bouquet of the beer consists of floral hops. In the mouth, the bitterness is quite strong, without being extreme, and the alcohol makes its presence known, without being domineering. The aftertaste is dry and less syrupy than a barley wine. Thus, it is a very complex and bitter beer, but always well balanced.",,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is indeed a trend in North America to bring certain styles of beer to their extreme, and tag them as ""Double"", everything in this beer being exagerated (mostly bitterness and alcohol) when compared to the original style. In Dieu du Ciel's Double Triple, the beer is very strong and the presence of alcohol is evident in the smell as well as in the taste of the beer. Pronounced hops aromas are also present, due to dry hopping.

Dieu du ciel,MONKRIEK,,Cherry oud bruin,"The beer as we know it today only dates back a little over 125 years. Pasteur demonstrated in 1876 the mechanism of fermentation. In 1886, Hensen isolated for the first time a pure strain of yeast. Before this time, fermentation was misunderstood and brewing was an empirical process. The beer had many characteristics, which in our day, would be looked upon as flaws. One of these flaws was the presence of acidity or sourness in the beer, especially the ones that had aged.It is in western Flanders, Belgium, where they brew to this day a beer with those characteristics: the Oud Bruid (old brown). This red beer with a fruity bouquet has a very poignant sour flavour. These beers come from a mixed fermentation where the starter culture is made up of both yeast and bacteria. If the yeast produces alcohol, then the bacteria produce lactic acid which gives the beer its refreshing taste.Germany has banned the beer through their purity law, but Belgians have a tradition of fruit beers, especially those made with cherries and raspberries. The aromas and acidity of these fruit harmonize perfectly with sour beers like the oud bruin or the lambic.The MonKriek is a ruby red beer with a red fruit bouquet. To the taste, is full-bodied with hints of caramel and fruit. The sourness of the beer harmonizes with the cherry to produce red wine characteristics. This beer is made with genuine sour cherries macerated in the beer to produce a secondary fermentation. No artificial or natural aromas or flavours are added. The goal is not to make a fruity alcohol drink, but to harmonize the intrinsic qualities of a complex beer with those of the cherries.",,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dieu du ciel,SAISON ST-LOUIS,,saison,"The brewing of the Saison St-Louis is inspired by the beers that are brewed in the south-west of Belgium. The term “Saison” refers to a family of beers rather than a precise style. In the old days, this beer was brewed on farms where there was a brewery that served the needs of the workers and the owners. These breweries produced the Saison during the winter months so that they could drink the beer in the summer, when it was too hot to brew. To preserve the beer over several months, the beers had to be stronger in alcohol content and/or more hops were added than in other beers. The artisan or small scale production of these beers made it so that the recipes varied wildly from one brewery to another. The grain used depended on the cereals available at the farm when the beer was being brewed: barley, wheat, rye, buckwheat, or spelt. The malt drying procedures, being more archaic at the time, made for beers that were much darker than they are today. Today, these beers tend to be blond. The use of spices was left to the whim of the brewer, but they were always used in moderation, and never to override the other flavours in the beer. It used to be a top fermenting beer, where the starter culture was mixed with different strains of yeast and lactate producing bacteria. With the evolution of brewing methods and knowledge in microbiological techniques, the lactic character of the beer disappeared over time. The Saison St-Louis is a contemporary version of the style. It is brewed with pale barley malt and a portion of raw wheat. The hoppiness of the beer comes from the use of English hops. Flavoured with coriander, it is a blond beer, very mildly acidic, of medium bitterness, full-bodied without being sweet, and has cookie and citrus flavours. This is the perfect thirst quencher after a hard day’s labour on the farm!",,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cantillon Brewery ,Gueuze 100% Organic Lambic,,,"We are a part of the brewing sector, which is in turn an important part of the food industry. Tens of thousands of people have tasted our beers or will do so one day.The Cantillon Brewery is very conscious of its responsibility towards its customers and our attitude proves it. Since the beginning, our aim has been twofold. On the one hand we defend an age-old tradition by brewing spontaneous fermentation beers. On the other hand we try to defend the natural taste of the beer within the gastronomy, and we aim for the highest quality by using only the best raw materials.This is why in 1999 the Cantillon Brewery decided to go back to its roots and to use organically grown cereals only. Since we need Lambic from three different years in order to make Gueuze, we had to wait until 2003 to present you with the first bottles labelled ""ecolabel"", certified by Ecocert. For the moment, the Organic Label doesn't apply to our fruit beers, because the quantities of organically grown cherries and raspberries are insufficient.Why Organic ? In these times when some farmers, who are conscious of the poor state of our environment and of our soils, have decided not to use chemical fertilizers or pesticides, the Cantillon Brewery wants to support this agriculture by using organically grown cereals for its beer.The label is a joint work by two Brussels artists: Raymond Goffin, the ""Marolles'"" painter, and André Mollekens, photograph. It naturally symbolizes the return to using organic cereals like ""in the Old Times"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cantillon Brewery ,Gueuze 100% Lambic,,,"In the 18th century, a Benedictine monk, dom Pérignon, discovers the champaign method by blending different non sparkling white wines. One century later, a Brabant brewer blends different lambics and brings about a spontaneous fermentation in the bottle. The Gueuze is born.Up to the 19th century, the people from Brussels and Brabant mostly drank two beers, Lambic and Faro. The glass bottle and the discovery of Dom Perignon will bring about a revolution in the small world of the Brussels brewers. The Gueuze became the icon of the Brussels beers.Lambic, which is the base for the making of Gueuze, is a spontaneous fermentation beer. All beers made with Lambic are naturally sour, but some will be more sour, more bitter or ""softer"" than the others.The Gueuze is the result of a well-considered blending of Lambics of different ages and with different tastes.The Lambic beers from the Cantillon brewery, which are conserved in oakwood barrels, are called ""young"" after one year, but they will reach their full maturity after three years. The young beers contain the sugars which are necessary for the second fermentation in the bottle. The three years old beers will contribute their taste and their flavour.The main task for the brewer, however, is tasting. He will taste about ten Lambics from different barrels in order to select five or six which will be used for the Gueuze 100% Lambic presenting the typical characteristics of the beers from the Cantillon brewery.The bottles are closed with a cork, capped with a crown-cork. They will remain horizontally in a cellar for a year on average, in order to allow the sugars to be converted into carbon dioxide (second fermentation in the bottle). The saturation of the beer is slow and natural. When the Lambic becomes sparkling, it is called Gueuze. At that moment, this crown-jewel of the Cantillon brewery will leave the cellar of the brewery and find its way to the cellars of the lovers of the traditional Gueuze.Every blending will produce a different Gueuze. Since we work according to a natural process, it is impossible to make a standard beer.This beer is not only unique because of its brewing process, but also because it can be conserved for a long time. When kept in a good cellar, a Cantillon Gueuze will still have an exceptional taste and flavour after 20 years.The Gueuze 100% Lambic Cantillon represents half of the production of the brewery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cantillon Brewery ,Kriek 100% Lambic,,,"Some pubs nowadays offer 200 or even 300 beers to their customers. It hasn't always been like this. Many years ago, only the local products were sold. In order to make the list a little bit longer, the brewers invented recipes based on the local fruits.The most famous among the fruit beers is without doubt the KriekOn a warm summer day, a lorry coming from the auction at Sint-Truiden delivers 4.000 kgs of fresh Kellery cherries to the brewery. The brewery staff will then put about 150 kgs of fruits in oakwood or chestnutwood barrels which can contain 650 litres of lambic and which have been cleaned some days before.These barrels are filled with healthy lambics which are more or less one and a half year old. These are not so easy to find, because many beers are still ill at that age. These ""oily"" beers will have to mature for some months in the main barrel. When the Kriek barrels are filled with the fruits and with the lambic (about 500 litres), the hole in the barrel is closed with a sheet of paper in order to avoid contact with impurities. Five days later, the fermentation starts. The sugars from the lambic and from the fruits bring about the activity of the yeasts which are concentrated in the wood and in the skin of the fruits. A marvelous pink or red foam decorates the old barrels in the cellar.\nNormally, the fermentation stops around the 10th of August. The barrels are then closed and the acid lambic begins to extract the taste and the colour from the fruits. Flies and mosquitoes haunt the cellars and are likely to provoke bad infections. Due to the presence of the home spider, however, a natural predator which is more efficient than any insecticide, the Cantillon Brewery presents a natural equilibrium which enables us to produce our beers.\nThe fermentation of the Kriek in the bottle generally starts in the beginning of October. Two barrels of Kriek from the first extraction and two from the second are pumped into a huge barrel. (The second extraction is obtained by filling the barrel for a second time in order to extract as much from the fruits as possible). It is also possible to blend a certain quantity of young lambic with the Kriek in order to obtain a second fermentation in the bottle. The Kriek goes through a natural saturation, normally after three to five months in the bottle. We recommend to drink the Kriek within one year after the bottling.\nThe fermentation will change the primary taste of the product and the Kriek will be dominated by the character of the lambic. The red colour will change into more oily shades. This is, however, a personal point of view. Some customers conserve their Kriek for a long time and like it that way. Kriek is a traditional summer beer. It is a very thirst-quenching beer which tastes deliciously with a big slice of brown bread with white cheese, radishes, onions and chives.\nYears ago, people who drank Kriek in a pub were also given two lumps of sugar and a ""stoemper"" on a small plate. With the ""stoemper"", the customer could crush the sugar on the bottom of his glass and sweeten it in a natural way in order to eliminate the sour taste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\nCantillon Brewery ,Rose de Gambrinus,,,"Kriek certainly already existed in the beginning of the 19th century. It is, however, more difficult to determine when the Framboise-Lambic appeared in the Brussels pubs.Anyway, the beer certainly was available in the beginning of the 20th century. Paul Cantillon mentions a higher number of bottles of Framboise than of Kriek in his inventory for 1909-1910. During the First World War, the fruit beers disappear from the inventory. From 1922 on, the Kriek will be produced again on a regular basis. As for the Framboise, it was produced for a short time in the thirties and disappeared from the inventory afterwards.In 1973, a friend of mine, Willy Gigounon, deliverded 150 kgs of raspberries at the brewery. The production of raspberry beers started again 40 years later.I was preparing a barrel of raspberry beer. The beer coming out of the small hole in the middle of the stave was marvelous.""It has the colour of onion skin"", said a voice behind me. \nIt was Raymond Coumans.\nHe was admiring the colour of the raspberry lambic reflecting in the red copper of the buckets used to empty the barrels. At that time (1986), ""Raspberry-Lambic"" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a rose, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.The process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Rose de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cantillon Brewery ,Grand Cru Bruocsella,,,"The Lambic Grand Cru Bruocsella Cantillon is a lambic which has matured for three years in oakwood barrels and has been selected for its exceptional colour, taste and flavour.Its light, slightly amber, yellow-gold colour and its aroma, a mixture of apples and honey, make the Grand Cru Bruocsella a very seductive beer.Its taste derives from its dry character and its slight and discreet acidity.When kept for a long time, its bouquet gets the fine flavour of roasted bread which, according to some, relates it to the white Burgundy ""Chardonnay""This aristocratic beer is to our national beer patrimony what Mouton-Rotschild, Petrus or Romanée-Conti are to the wines.\nJust like these top quality wines, the Lambic Grand Cru Bruocsella is not drunk but savoured and it can be served with the finest dishes.\nIts subtle taste enhances the savour of stewed dishes, underlines discreetly the taste of fish and crustaceans and constitutes a strong support for the taste of fine meat. Combined with sauerkraut, it tastes to full advantage.The beer is unique in the world. Its fermentation is spontaneous, without the addition of yeast, and is the result of the action of micro-organisms.After maturing for three years in oakwood barrels, it looks more like wine and its fine taste and flavours nearly make one forget that the Grand Cru Bruocsella Cantillon is a beer. This old lambic is bottled without any addition.The taste of the Grand Cru Bruocsella Cantillon will change in course of time and the beer can be kept for years. We recommend our customers to savour this old Lambic in wine glasses (tasting glasses).A matchless, marvelous, eternal beer…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cantillon Brewery ,Iris,,,"The Cantillon brewery is closely linked to Brussels, a city which has the iris as its symbol. As the name indicates, the ""marsh iris"" is a plant growing in humid areas. The historical center of Brussels is built on swamps where this flower used to grow abundantly.In 1998, the Brussels Museum of the Gueuze celebrated its 20th anniversary. The Cantillon brewery decided to make a new spontaneous fermentation beer for this occasion, named after this symbolic flower.It is a completely original beer which, contrary to the other products of the Brewery, is not brewed with 35% of wheat. The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities.After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called ""cold hopping"", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitterris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor.\nAlthough it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cantillon Brewery ,Vigneronne,,,"The lambic brewers weren't only established in the Senne valley, but also in the valley of the Yssche . This small river has its spring in the Forêt de Soignes and flows through villages like Hoeilaart, Overijse and Huldenberg. In this valley there used to live many brewers who made delicious lambic. They didn't add cherries or raspberries to their beer, but grapes which had been cultivated in greenhouses. By blending muscat grapes and lambic, the brewers and beer merchants produced the ""druivenlambik"" (grapes lambic).In 1973, Jean-Pierre Van Roy, after having relaunched successfully the production of raspberry lambic, bought white grapes and soaked them in lambic. This experiment was successful too. The fructose, which abounds in these fruits, enables us to make a beer which is more mellow than the Gueuze or the other fruit beers.The name Vigneronne Cantillon was given in 1987. This name reminds us that, while it belongs to the beer patrimony, the spontaneous fermentation, the ageing in the barrels for several years and the addition of grapes make it a distant cousin of certain white wines.La Vigneronne, malgré son succès, représente moins de 5% de la production totale de la brasserie Cantillon. Afin d'obtenir les fruits les plus mûrs possible, nous les achetons en fin de saison. Une tonne de raisins blancs italiens débarque chaque année au début du mois d'octobre.In spite of its success, the Vigneronne represents less than 5% of the total production of the Cantillon brewery. In order to obtain grapes which are as mature as possible, we buy them at the end of the season. Every year, 1000 kilos of white italian grapes are delivered at the Cantillon brewery in the beginning of OctobeIt is difficult to produce more Vigneronne even though the demand exists. All the grapes are picked from the bunch by hand and we don't have much time, since the new brewing season starts at the end of October.The beers are not blended before the bottling. The second fermentation is caused by the addition of a sugared liquor. The six-pointed star on our label is an alchemist's symbol. It contains four elements, represented by triangles, of the brewing process. The fire is the symbol of the mashing tun, the earth of the cereals, the air of the yeasts, and the water is the fourth element. At this moment, only a brewer of traditional lambic may use this symbol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cantillon Brewery ,Saint Lamvinus,,,"Everyone knows some of our best friends are wine growers from the Libourne region in France, more specifically those who make Saint Emillion and Pomerol. They respect the tradition and let their wine ferment in a natural way. Fermentation, origin and vintage are still kept up.\nOur collaboration resulted in a product uniting the best of their wine and of our beer : the Saint-Lamvinus.The grapes, of the merlot and cabernet-franc varieties, are soaked in Bordeaux barrels containing two to three years old lambic. The beer is not blended before the bottling. The foam is caused by the addition of a liquor which starts the fermentation. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cantillon Brewery ,Fou' Foune,,,"It was 1998. There was a friendly atmosphere, the food was excellent, it was a perfect occasion to improve the world and let our imagination run away. Improving the world has remained an illusion, but one of our fantasies has become reality. François Daronnat, an apricot grower nicknamed ""Foufoune"" was one of the participants.\nHe kept on singing the praises of his ""Bergeron"" apricots : they were the most natural, the most beautiful, the most delicious, sweet and acid at the same time.\n""With those apricots, I could brew you a beer, dear François"", I told him. But my spirits got bemused by the great Rhône wines and I forgot all the dreams and crazy ideas which pop up at these great moments.\nFoufoune, however, hadn't forgotten about the apricots and the beer: on a morning in July 1998, I discovered all of a sudden 300 kgs of deliciously mature ""Bergerons"" outside the Cantillon brewery.\nFoufoune was obviously someone who kept his promises.\nIt was up to us now. The result was perfect and the limited production of apricots lambic was destined for a small part of the French market.\nDue to the success of our provençal beer, 1200 kgs of apricots are delivered now every year to the Cantillon brewery. The fruits are stoned by hand before being soaked in 2 years old lambic. The beer extracts the taste and the aromas very quickly and the Fou'Foune is bottled after two months. The beer is rather sour, slightly turbid and has a pale gold colour. Its production is limited to 3000 liters a year. A large part of the bottles go back to the region where these apricots come from. People there consider the Fou'Foune Cantillon as a local beer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cantillon Brewery ,Lou Pepe,,,"The traditional Lambic is a beer whose spontaneous fermentation cannot be controlled entirely by the brewer. Due to the influence of many factors, the taste and the aromas of our product are different every time we brew.In a lambic brewery, every bottling (about 50 each season at the Cantillon brewery) results in a beer with its own more or less complex taste. These differences are one of the characteristics of the Gueuze, Kriek or Framboise. The lambic beers are blended in order to neutralize these differences and to be able to offer our customers a beer with a harmonious taste the whole season throughThe Lou Pepe beers deviate from these principles. The Gueuze Lou Pepe is made with two years old lambic beers with a mellow taste, often coming from barrels in which only wine has been kept before. In July, the same kind of beer is used to make the Lou Pepe Kriek and Framboise. With these beers too, the fruits are soaked in barrels coming directly from Bordeaux. The second fermentation of these particular beers is not caused by the addition of young lambic but of a sweet liquor. The yeast will transform the sugar in carbon dioxide. All the lambic beers which are used, are brewed in the same season and the use of liquor instead of young lambic makes the taste of the fruit more intense. The Kriek and the Rosé de Gambrinus contain 200 g of fruits per liter on an average, while the Lou Pepe beers contain about 300 g. This fruity taste, combined with the wine flavour coming from the Bordeaux barrels, distinguishes these special beers from the other Cantillon products.\nThe particular name of these beers comes from the south-west of France, a region the Cantillon family is very fond of. In this beautiful region, the grandfather is called Lou Pepe. To his grandchildren Florian, Simon, Louis and Sylvain, the master-brewer is the Lou Pepe of the North.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smuttynose Brewing Co.,Finestkind IPA,,IPA,"Portsmouth is a colonial era seaport town, so it goes to follow that sooner or later we'd brew an India Pale Ale as a tribute to those big, hoppy 19th century ales that made the long sea voyage from England's temperate shores, 'round the Cape of Good Hope, to the sultry climes of the faraway East Indies.But there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. Ten years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: “Why don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?”You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they’ll be quite pleased.\nABV 6.9%",,6.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smuttynose Brewing Co.,Wheat Wine Ale,,Wheat wine Ale,"Smuttynose Wheat Wine Ale is a unique hybridization of two well-known beer styles, combining the rich, voluptuous taste of a traditional barleywine with the subtle, tart flavors of an American wheat ale, topped off with a healthy dose of crisp, herbaceous hops.The much-anticipated debut edition of Smuttynose Wheat Wine, brewed and bottled early in 2005, was delayed for nearly a year due to problems stemming from the federal label approval process. The Tax and Trade Bureau (formerly ATF) rejected our original label approval application, claiming that use of the word wine in a beer name would confuse and mislead consumers and retailers. We didn't agree (barleywine, anyone?) and appealed their rejection. Ours is the first, but definitely not the last, wheat wine application the federal government has seen, so they had to create new guidelines regarding the use of this name. We did prevail, at last, and the issue has been put to rest, and although there are several outstanding examples of this style offered at brewpubs, we are pleased to say that Smuttynose Wheat Wine Ale was the first commercially bottled Wheat Wine on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ballast Point Brewing Company,Yellowtail Pale Ale,,Pale Ale,"Cologne is a bustling city on the Rhine river known for its huge Gothic cathedral, Roman ruins, Carnival celebration (rivaling New Orleans' Mardi Gras), and most importantly, Kolsch. Kolsch is Cologne's own beer style and it is brewed by 21 different breweries. This makes Cologne the city with the most breweries in the world! (although Denver and Portland are catching up fast) What is unusual about this is that all of these breweries brew the same style of beer. Kolsch is a pale colored ale of normal alcohol strength. It may contain some wheat, and has from 22 to 28 I.B.U.s of bitterness. German Tettnang or Spalt hops are typically used for aroma. It is made very much like a pilsner, except that it is fermented at warm temperatures with ale yeast. It is then lagered like a pilsner. It tastes very much like a pils, except for the subdued fruitiness of the ale yeast, the tang of the wheat (in some), and the lack of lager-like sulfur aromas.It is customarily served in small (6.5 oz) tall cylindrical glasses. This makes it very easy to order another one, and hard to keep count. The waiter (known as a kurbis, and clad in traditional white shirt and blue apron) keeps count by marking your coaster for each one you drink. Traditional foods to have with a Kolsch are Kolsch caviar (a roll with butter), A halve hahn (a roll with cheese), sauerbraten, and potato pancakes with apple sauce (Wednesdays only). Why should there be 21 Kolsch breweries? At first all the beers seem very similar. After spending some time in Cologne you start to pick up on big differences. Malzmuhle (my favorite) is the maltiest, Paffgen has a big hop nose. Fruh, by the Cathedral, is extremely delicate. Sion is soft and Sunner has a perfect hop balance.So where can you taste a Kolsch? There are no Kolsches being imported into the United States. So you could fly to Cologne. A better idea is to come to Ballast Point Brewing Company and try our Yellowtail Pale Ale Kolsch. We make it with 5% Wheat, finish hop it with Liberty and Tettnanger hops, and ferment it with a yeast we borrowed from a brewery in Cologne. So come on in and enjoy a taste of the Rhineland!!",,,,,22-28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ballast Point Brewing Company,Calico Amber Ale,,Amber Ale,"The Calico Amber Ale was inspired by the beers of England. In England most of the beer is some kind of ""bitter"". Bitter is a style that became popular in the late 1800's. The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent. This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish, hence the name ""bitter."" A brewery usually brews several bitters of various alcohol strengths. The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called ""bitter"" or ""ordinary bitter."" A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us ""best bitter"" or ""special bitter."" Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an ""extra special bitter"" or E.S.B.Although inspired by the British Ales Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma. We brew Calico Amber Ale with 100% malt and use 4 different malts to give it a rich complexity. The blend of crystal malts give it flavors including toffee and caramel. A blend of American Cascade and Centennial hops provide a counterpoint to the malt. Finally our proprietary yeast provides a fruity background and a Madeira like richness that rounds out this gold medal winning ale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ballast Point Brewing Company,Big Eye IPA,,IPA,"India Pale Ale is a style of beer that was developed in England during the period of the British Empire. It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.British troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors. Big Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style. American Centennial hops are used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ballast Point Brewing Company,Black Marlin Porter,,Porter,"Black Marlin Porter (Dark, creamy, velvet smooth American style Porter we brewed this beer because we couldn't find it anywhere else!)\nPorters are a style of beer that developed in London in the mid 1800's.  It has a confusing and difficult to sort out their history. We know that some Porters began as a bartender's blend of three ales that would be ordered as ""three strands."" Breweries caught on to the popularity of the blend and began to brew beers having the characteristics of the blend. This popular beer became known as Porter, because railroad porters were its biggest fans.A typical London workingman's meal of the time might have consisted of Porter, bread, and oysters (which were then considered to be lower class fare). As different styles of Porters developed, one of the most popular was dry porter, which emphasized the use of roasted barley. This type of Porter eventually became known as Stout. Today the use of roasted barley distinguishes Stouts from Porters.Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter is a rich dark chocolaty Porter with a distinctive American hop character. It is a great beer to go with hearty foods and is surprisingly one of the few beers that goes well with dessert. One of our favorite combinations here at Ballast Point is Black Marlin Porter with apple pie a la mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ballast Point Brewing Company,Wahoo Wheat Beer,,belgian White Ale,"White beers are an old Belgian beer style that come from a region near Liege centered on the small town of Hoegaarden. In the 1800's there were 30 white beer breweries in this region. Then Belgian brewing went through a period of consolidation and homogenization. By the early sixties there were no Wit beer breweries left. Pierre Celis reopened Hoegaarden's brewery in 1966 and began a worldwide revival of the style.Recently Celis moved to Austin, Texas and opened Celis Brewing Company, thus bringing this style to the United States. For a few months Celis White was distributed in San Diego, but then distribution was stopped. Avid fans like Ballast Point Brewmasters Peter A'Hearn and Yuseff Cherney were left to brew their own. Through long trial and error we developed a recipe that does justice to the old Belgian tradition, now sold in San Diego as Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer.Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is created using the same ingredients that were once used in Belgium. Flaked unmalted wheat, oats and malted barley comprise the grain. The unmalted wheat has a high protein content, which causes the beer to be hazy, thus giving it a cloudy, or ""white"" appearance. A special yeast gives a refreshing tangy flavor that is different from both the sour Weiss beers of Berlin or the banana and clovey Weizens of Bavaria. The mild hopping allows the unique malts to show through and does not conflict with the subtleties of the citrus spicing. This unique citrus character is created by adding a blend of curacao (bitter orange), sweet orange and coriander to the boil. White beers are light and refreshing, yet provide a complex reminder that interesting high quality beer does not have to be bitter and dark. Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is the perfect beer for sunny San Diego.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs,Abbaye des Rocs,,,"Abbaye des Rocs (9% alcohol vol.) is a pure malt beer, with no added sugar. The entire range of tastes is directly linked to the double fermentation, the precise quantities of malts (7 types) as well as the mixtures of three kinds of hops (Belgian, German and Czech). Its colour is a striking deep and majestic red. Its taste is rich and full of subtlety. It is tasted like a red wine with which it shares the ruby colour without having the tannin. It develops a strong sweet smell. It confirms the initial impression in the first mouthful, with a sharp body that is balanced with a certain fruitiness. It frees itself on the palate and develops an impressive depth of taste. Some traces of burnt wood are detectable, but never scorched even if it contains this kind of malt. The foretaste is very prolonged because of its rich and unctuous development throughout the mouth. The bitter and sugar tendencies (even though there is no sugar in its composition) compete and come back together to the taster's great satisfaction. It is a deep, mystic and extremely mature beer to be classed among the great products of our soil.",,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs,Montagnarde,,,"The inhabitants of Montignies-sur-Roc, south of Mons in the province of Hainaut, are called Montagnards.

It has a fruity and spicy bouquet, it has a stark taste, between a sharp bitterness and a caramelised flavour. It has no sugar, and this pure malt beer oscillates between various tendencies which all round off the bitterness. It has a peppery taste at the back of the mouth and a sharpness on the tongue. It is active in the mouth and lets each flavour express itself individually. It is very active in the glass which gives it a full, lasting, head. It has a long conclusion and puts emphasis on an ever present bitterness but less supported by the caramel. The final impression is one of gingerbread without sugar.",,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also stronger (6%) than the Blanches that we know. Its taste is surprising and is not comparable to the brews with the same name that are now on the market. If the bouquet is subdued its first flavour is a stark dry sharpness against a pepper background. There is no acidity in this Blanche that is made with three cereals (barley, wheat, oats).

By blending the two batches, an additional complexity is imparted. Further complexity, most notably expressed by the delicate vanilla notes, was gained by aging some of the beer in new oak barrels Similar to our other ales, Tenth Anniversary is bottle conditioned. Just prior to bottling, a fresh dose of sugar and yeast was added to the 'still' beer (at this stage there is no carbonation present). After bottling, the beer was aged in the warm room, where the fresh dose of yeast ferments the sugar, and naturally carbonates the beer. The batch of Tenth Anniversary was bottled in May of '05 (800 cases, six bottles in each case), and it is the only batch that will be available. Due to the unique brewing process of this special ale, it is important to store the bottle upright and serve it cold.

After bottling, the beer is aged in our temperature-controlled cellar, where the yeast ferments the sugar and naturally carbonates the beer. This process, known as méthode champenoise, is the same traditional process we use for all of our bottled beers. The batch of 11th Anniversary Ale was bottled in May of '06 - 950 cases, six bottles in each case and is the only batch that will be available. Its aroma is redolent of red licorice, nutmeg, wild apple, and hard candy. Its taste is malty with date and fig notes with a finish that is crisp, striking a balance between dry and fruity. We suggest serving this rustic brew at cellar temperature.",,9.2,1089,,,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Allagash Brewing Company,Alagash Fluxus '07,,,"(fluk-suhs) -noun, Latin. a flowing or flow a continuous change, passage or movementAllagash Fluxus is so named because it is the first beer brewed in our new brewery.

Finally Fluxus, like all our beers, undergoes a second fermentation, the methode champenoise, by which we naturally carbonate our beer in the bottle.

Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Victoria Ale,,,"To create our unique, Belgian-style Victoria Ale, the brewers drew on references to Bacchus, the Thracian god of wine, in the history and artwork of the Victoria Mansion as inspiration for this new beer. One hundred and fifty pounds of Chardonnay grapes were brought in, crushed on site and added directly to the mash.Victoria Ale's aroma is of fruity spice with a hint of the Chardonnay, and the taste presents subtle notes of green banana, black pepper, and fresh-crushed mint. With a focus on the subtle, wine-like character of the grapes, the 9.0% ABV brew boasts a pale copper color, Belgian yeast influence, and a medium body with a long candied fruit finish with hints of honeydew melon, and, of course, Chardonnay. Allagash Victoria Ale is a tribute to the historic Victoria Mansion here in Portland, Maine. Also known as the Morse-Libby House, it is one of the greatest 19th century houses in the United States. Designed by architect Henry Austin, the mansion was built between 1858 and 1860 and survives as a unique example of the princely palaces created for America's wealthiest citizens in the pre-Civil War era. With superb architecture and well-preserved original interiors, the Victoria Mansion is an unparalleled document of America's highest aspirations in architecture, interior design, and the decorative arts. \nThe Victoria Mansion has operated as a museum since it was saved from demolition in 1940, and today the non-profit organization that owns it remains committed to its preservation and interpretation to a wide audience. Allagash Brewing Company has partnered with the Victoria Mansion to help in the restoration of this National Historic Landmark. For every bottle of Victoria Ale purchased, Allagash will donate $1 towards helping restore the mansion, located on Danforth Street in downtown Portland",,9,1080,,,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Victor Ale,,,"The Victor Ale was inspired by its feminine-named predecessor, the Victoria Ale.

Over one hundred pounds of chancellor grapes were crushed on site and added directly to the mash. In addition to a generous portion of Pilsner malt, Victor is hopped with Fuggles and Hallertau and fermented with a wine yeast strain. With a focus on the subtle wine-like character of the grapes, the 9.0% ABV brew maintains a copper color, wine yeast influence and a medium body with a tart and spicy finish.Allagash Victor Ale is a tribute to the St. Lawrence Arts and Community Center, perched at the crest of Munjoy Hill in the Portland's East End.

Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Hugh Malone Ale,,,"Hugh Malone Ale's base includes English two-row malt and pale crystal malts, establishing an understated sweetness. To give Hugh Malone its hop character we use generous portions of Simcoe hops at three points in the brewing process. To begin with, we use a technique referred to as first wort hopping, in which Simcoe is added to the sweet wort as it enters the kettle. When the wort comes to a boil in the kettle we add Warrior hops, adding another layer to the bitterness of the beer. Later in the brewing process we steep a large amount of Simcoe in the whirlpool to impart a distinct hop aroma. Finally, during secondary fermentation in our conditioning tanks, we dry hop the beer, which instills a hoppy aroma with notes of pine and grapefruit. This 8.5 % ABV ale has a malty palate and a pronounced bitterness. It has a pleasant dry, hoppy finish.Hugh Malone is a tribute to responsible agricultural practices and informed consumption. Allagash Brewing Company is donating $1 from every bottle of Hugh Malone sold to the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA), the country's oldest and largest state organic farmer coalition. MOFGA is a non-profit organization that educates farmers and gardeners about organic cultivation. They work to create resources for consumers interested in buying local and organic foods.

Allagash Brewing Company,Allagash Interlude,,belgian ale,"The first release in our new experimental series, Allagash Interlude pushes the limits of beer. An innovative brewing process, special fermentations, and French oak barrel aging all contribute to a beer that has remarkable wine-like qualities.Two yeast strains were used to create this unique 9.5% ABV Belgian style ale. The first, a Belgian farmhouse yeast, establishes the flavor foundations of a classic Belgian-style ale. The second, a house strain of Brettanomyces yeast, brings it to the next level contributing an intriguing myriad of flavors including pear, apricot, graham cracker, and bread crust. Finally, a portion of the Interlude is aged in French Merlot and Sirah oak barrels, which impart a distinctive vinous plum character and a drying, almost tannic finish. Try complementing its audacious character with food pairings such as sausages, salami, smoked meats, and bold cheeses. True to traditional Belgian-style brewing, we bottle condition the Interlude. Just prior to bottling, a fresh dose of sugar and yeast is added to the 'still beer' (at this stage there is no carbonation present).

Oskar Blues Grill and Brew,Dale's Pale Ale,,Pale Ale,"Dale's Pale Ale is our flagship beer and America's first hand-canned craft beer. It's an assertive but deftly balanced beer (somewhere between an American pale ale and an India Pale Ale) brewed with hefty amounts of European malts and American hops.It features a merengue-like head, a copper color, and a hoppy nose, thanks to a big post-boil addition of Centennial hops. To complement its hoppy first impression, Dale's also sports a rich middle of malts and hops, and a bracing finish. Dale's is 6.5% alcohol by volume, and features 65 International Bittering Units. We think of it as the perfect, everyday beer for hopheads like us. Dale's Pale Ale's rich flavor has helped us make many new fans, and its numerous honors have helped us kick huge holes in the misconceptions regarding cans.",,6.5,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oskar Blues Grill and Brew,Old Chub,,Scottish Strong Ale,"Old Chub is a Scottish strong ale brewed with hearty amounts of seven different malts, including crystal and chocolate malts, and a smidge of US and UK hops. Old Chub also gets a dash of beechwood-smoked grains imported from Bamburg, Germany, home of the world's greatest smoked beers. Old Chub is 8% alcohol by volume.While Dale's satisfies our hop addiction, Old Chub takes care of our deep affections for malt.\nThe cola-colored beer (almost black) features a tan head, a creamy, skim-milk mouthfeel, and rich, semi-sweet flavors of caramel and chocolate throughout. The addition of smoked grains gives Old Chub a delicate kiss of smoke on the finish.Old Chub is the beer equivalent of a lightly smoked single malt scotch, or your favorite dark chocolate. We call it Rocky Mountain Mutha's Milk. People who tell us defiantly, ""I don't drink dark beer,"" often fall deeply in love with Old Chub. We can't blame them.",,8 to 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oskar Blues Grill and Brew,Gordon,,,"Gordon is a hybrid version of strong ale, somewhere between an Imperial Red and a Double IPA. We make it with six different malts and three types of hops, then dry-hop it with a mutha lode of Amarillo hops. It is 8.7% alcohol by volume, and has 85 International Bittering Units.It features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.We brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado's first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.Originally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.",,8.7,,,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oskar Blues Grill and Brew,Ten Fidy,,Imperial Stout,"Ten FIDY Imperial Stout - Now (11-21-07) available in cans, our winter seasonal beer is immensely viscous and loaded with neck-deep flavors of chocolate, malt, coffee, cocoa and oats.It's the beer equivalent of decadently rich milkshake made with malted-milk balls and Heaven's best chocolate ice cream. Ten FIDY is about 10% ABV and is made with enormous amounts of two-row malts, chocolate malts, roasted barley, flaked oats and hops. Its huge-but-comforting flavors hide a whopping 98 IBUs that are deftly tucked underneath the beer's mountains of malty goodness.Ten FIDY is the ultimate Rocky Mountain winter warmer, and further proof of the creative muscle of our beloved brewing staff. Look for fourpacks of Ten FIDY in select beer stores in Colorado. Out of state? We hope to send a few cases to a few of our other states in early '08.",,10,,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oskar Blues Grill and Brew,Mama's Little Yella Pils,,Pilsner,"Our new canned good is a delicious, small-batch version of the beer that made Pilsen, Czechoslovakia famous. Mama's is made with hearty amounts of pale malt, German specialty malts, and traditional (Saaz) and 21st century Bavarian hops. It's the perfect antidote for the watered-down, cornfed versions of pilsner clogging America's shelves. Our first canned lager, it's also fermented at cool temperatures with a German yeast. While it's rich with Czeched-out flavor, Mama's gentle hopping (about 35 IBUs) and low ABV (just 5.3%) makes it a luxurious but low-dose beer. Look for our Gold Metal Winner on US shelves in March. Sadly, the Feds rejected our ""Take Two and Call Us in the Morning"" line on the can.",,5.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Avery Brewing ,India Pale Ale,,IPA,"n the 1700's one crafty brewer discovered that a healthy dose of hops and an increased alcohol content preserved his ales during the long voyage to India (as depicted in our label) to quench the thirst of British troops.

Avery Brewing ,Collaboration not Litigation Ale,,Belgian,"Salvation. The name of two intricate Belgian-style ales, created by us, Vinnie Cilurzo of Russian River Brewing and Adam Avery of Avery Brewing. After becoming friends a few years ago, we realized we both had a Salvation in our lineups. Was it going to be a problem? Should one of us relinquish the name rights? ""Hell, no!"" we said. In fact, it was quickly decided that we should blend the brews to catch the best qualities of each and create an even more complex and rich libation. In April 2004, in a top secret meeting at Russian River Brewing (well, actually it was packed in the pub and many were looking over our shoulders wondering what the hell was going on), we came up with the perfect blend of the two Salvations. Natalie, Vinnie's much more significant other, exclaimed, ""We should call this Collaboration, not Litigation Ale!"" ""Perfect,"" we shouted! We celebrated deep into the night (or is that morning?). Fast forward to November 14, 2006. After talking about it for over two years, we finally decided to pull the trigger and Vinnie made the journey to Avery Brewing to brew his Salvation exactly as he does in his brewery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perhaps UFO's initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head. The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO. Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing. When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.\nThe aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character. This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon. The lemon accentuates the yeast's fruity, tart fragrance. UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body. The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor. UFO has a clean finish. Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.\nThe overall character is a cloudy appearance with a citrus-like aroma, light body, and clean finish.

We used beechwood smoked malt from Bamberg, Germany to craft this copper-colored ale that evokes Rauchfetzen, a poetic German word meaning ""wisp of smoke.""

Harpoon,Glacier Harvest '08 Wet Hop Beer,,Wet Hop Pale Ale,"Brew Date: 8/12/08\nPackaging Date: 8/26/08\nFor the 24th session of the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series, we're celebrating this year's hop harvest with Glacier Harvest Wet Hop beer, a pale ale made with fresh Glacier hops.\nWet hop beers are brewed using fresh, ""wet"" hops instead of traditional dried hops--hops contain about 60% moisture when they are first picked. Typically, when hops are picked they are quickly dried and refrigerated to increase shelf life and make them more consistent for brewing. Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops. This yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.\nHarpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest. The result is a copper-colored ale with a pleasing blend of fresh hop flavor and sweet malt.",,6.7,16,,38,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Harpoon,Old Rusty's Red Rye Ale,,Red Rye Ale,"Shortly after starting Harpoon back in 1986, co-founders Rich Doyle and Dan Kenary hired their first employee: a brewer. That brewer was Russ Heissner. Rich and Dan lured Russ to Boston from sunny California after he graduated from the acclaimed brewing program at UC Davis with the hope of brewing great craft beer. Little did Russ know he would start his brewing career brewing test-batches in a bathtub in his Brighton, MA apartment. His ingenuity resulted in the first Harpoon beer, Harpoon Ale. Russ has gone on from Harpoon to pursue other interests, but has remained a great friend of Harpoon and a devoted connoisseur of craft beer. \nFor the 23rd installment of the 100 Barrel Series, we invited Russ back to brew a Harpoon beer once again.

Harpoon,Firth of Forth Ale,,Scottish Ale,"The story of Harpoon's Steve Stewart's Firth of Forth Ale began at Harpoon a decade ago. Back in 1998 a young Scottish brewer named Steve Stewart crossed the big pond and came to Harpoon in Boston as part of a brewery intern exchange program. Steve apprenticed at Harpoon for a couple months then took his new-found appreciation of American craft beer back to his full-time brewing job at a large Irish brewery. After some time, Steve decided to return to his birthplace - Scotland - and open his own microbrewery.\nOver the years, Steve kept in touch with the brewers at Harpoon, filling them in on his brewing progress. In April 2007 when Harpoon staff took their annual employee anniversary trip, they paid a special visit to Steve's microbrewery in Edinburgh, Scotland. Between toasting pints of Steve's award-winning cask ales the Harpoon brewers invited Steve to guest brew a 100 Barrel Series beer. He accepted with delight. For several months Steve and our brewers collaborated on the recipe, an American twist on a traditional Scottish Ale.",,5.4,13.2,,28,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Harpoon,Weizenbock,,Weizenbock,"Our Weizenbock is a celebration of flavor. This beer is brewed with fifty percent Wheat malt, which keeps it light on the palate, while the dark German barley malts round out the grain bill to create a full-flavored, creamy mouthfeel. \nGerman-grown Hersbrucker hops offer up a subtle balance, but the true character of this joyous beer is derived from the authentic Bavarian yeast strain. This yeast invites notes of banana, clove, and spice to the party, creating a warming holiday elixir. Enjoy with friends!",,7.8,18.5,,16,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Harpoon,Glacier Harvest Wet Hop Beer,,Wet Hop Pale Ale,"The 20th installment of the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series has been brewed to celebrate the annual hop harvest.Harpoon Glacier Harvest Wet Hop beer is a pale ale made with fresh hops picked just hours before being tossed into the brew.\nWet hop beers are brewed using fresh, wet (hops contain about 60% moisture when they are first picked) hops instead of traditional dried hops. Typically, when hops are picked they are quickly dried and refrigerated to make them more suitable and consistent for brewing. This process allows brewers to use hops that were harvested in the fall throughout the following year. Alternatively, wet hops need to be used within hours of their being harvested or they will begin to rapidly degrade. Wet hops retain some of their natural oils and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.\nHarpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, harvested the Glacier hops in Seneca New York the morning of August 13th and immediately drove them back to Boston that very afternoon in a refrigerated truck.Ray added the newly harvested hops to the brew within hours after the harvest.The fresh hops were added to a malty, copper-colored ale. The combination is a pleasing blend of fresh hop flavor and sweet malt.",,6.7,16,,38,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Harpoon,Peche,,Peche,"Rich Doyle, Harpoon’s CEO and co-founder, first tasted this Belgian style beer in Brugge three years ago while traveling on a Harpoon beer culture trip. He immediately fell in love with the beer and wanted to brew a batch ever since.\nThe Harpoon Pêche is reminiscent of the peach lambics Rich and other Harpoon employees enjoyed on their trip to Belgium. As you pour this hazy golden colored beer, you will immediately notice the fresh peach aroma rising from your glass. A high carbonation level assists in releasing the aromatics of this crisp, sparkling ale. The five malts used to brew this beer blend nicely with the fresh fruit added during fermentation, creating a sweetness that is full but not cloying or candy-like. This sweetness is balanced by the tart acidity in the finish of the beer. The combination creates an incredibly refreshing experience. This is a perfect beer for the summer and can be paired with a variety of cheeses and deserts, or simply enjoyed on its own.",,5.0,13,,15,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Harpoon,Refsvindinge Private Stock,,Danish Farmhouse Ale,"Each year at Harpoon, employees celebrating their 5th anniversary are taken on a beer culture trip somewhere in Europe. On these trips, the Harpooners try different beer styles and visit many breweries across various regions. A few years ago a group visited the Refsvindinge Brewery in Denmark. John, the brewmaster, welcomed the Harpoon crew in to his home (which was connected to the brewery) for hours on end, where they drank his handcrafted beer and learned about his brewery. John didn't speak a word of English so his daughter, Lene, had to stay home from work to translate everything to the group. It was a memorable experience for everyone who was there.\nFor this 100 Barrel Series beer, Harpoon's brewmaster, Al Marzi, worked with John from the Refsvindinge Brewery to recreate a style they enjoyed while on the trip years ago. They worked together via email and, again, John's daughter Lene was asked to do all the email translation. The result, which was brewed by Brett Simmons at our Windsor, VT brewery, is the Refsvindinge Private Stock -- a Danish Farmhouse Ale",,7.8,18.5,,25,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Harpoon,Frankenfest,,Octoberfest Lager,"Frankenfest, brought to life by Harpoon brewer Mike Smith, was originally brewed exclusively for a beer festival held in Boston in 2004. The beer was greatly enjoyed by all who drank it - so much so that it has been resurrected as the latest offering in Harpoon's 100 Barrel Series.\nFrankenfest is brewed in the tradition of classic German Oktoberfest lagers. In order to replicate the complex malt character of the original, a blend of 8 different malts was used. The combination yields a slightly darker color and a toastier malt flavor. Frankenfest is judiciously hopped with three different varieties of hops that lend just enough bitterness to balance out the rich malt flavors. It has a dry finish compliments of an authentic German lager yeast and a longer rest in our conditioning tanks. The lingering malt complexity and dry finish make Frankenfest a wonderful match with many types of food. Enjoy.",,6.9,16,,26,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to achieve the crisp bitterness and aromatic nose, we brewed with Tetnanger and Czech Saaz hops. The beer was dry hopped with the Saaz as well. The authentic Bohemian Pilsner yeast added depth and after a prolonged lagering period helped produce much of the character of this beer. Our Bohemian Pilsner has a smooth, slightly malty flavor that is balanced with a crisp bitterness and clean hop aroma. It brings back great memories of our trip every time I taste it.\nI hope you enjoy it as well.",,4.7,12,,42,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Always handcrafted, the bottle you hold is brewed for the adventurous soul. This is a very limited edition and we make no promises to ever brew this style again. \nThis beer was inspired by the writings of Graham Wheeler, a noted English Beer Historian. \nMr. Wheeler describes the original Porters as: \n""... the least understood of the old British beers. The subject (of the Porter Beer Style) is complicated and confused because porter's heyday lasted from about 1700 to the pale ale revolution of the mid 1800's. During that time it passed through many transformations. Porter was simply a mixture of two brown beers. The only characteristic that set the porter apart from any other beer of the day was that porter was deliberately soured by adding a percentage of sour beer to freshly brewed beer. The original porters were not, as is commonly supposed, jet-black in colour, but a translucent brown. They had a rich, smoky flavor derived from the use of brown malt and a winey aftertang produced by the deliberate souring, highly regarded by Londoners."" \nOur interpretation is a Brown Porter based on the style popular in 1870's London. It was brewed with mostly floor malted English malts including the famed pale ale malt, Maris Otter. A touch of smoked malt produced by Briess Malting Company of Chilton Wisconsin was also used. Half of the batch went through a souring fermentation, in the traditional way, to promote the characteristic wine-like acidity.

McMenamins,Irish Stout,,Stout,"What better way to honor St. Patrick's Day than with a fabulous stout brewed in the dry Irish style. McMenamins Irish Stout belongs to the dry Irish family and is brewed in the tradition of many famous Irish brews including Murphys, Beamish, and of course, Guinness. The term dry refers to the lack of residual sweetness found in some stouts. This quality provides a clean, crisp and refreshing draught. Aromas of chocolate and malt combine with hoppy, herbal nuances. The taste is complex, including pronounced roast barley flavors and a rich, bready warmth. These essences give way to a pleasing chocolate-espresso richness balanced by an herbal hop twang.",,4.77,1.044,1.007,,spring,185,16 oz,,"Great Western Pale Malt, Great Western Flaked Barley, Hugh Baird Chocolate Malt, Hugh Baird Brown Malt and Hugh Baird Roast Material",,Chinook and Yakima Golding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
McMenamins,Workingman's Red,,Red Ale,"Embrace the change of seasons with McMenamins Spring Seasonal, Workingman's Red. The Vernal Equinox celebrates the renewed life of the Earth that comes with spring. It is a solar festival, observed when the length of night and day (on the equator, at least) are equal, striking a perfect balance between dark and light. Workingman's Red is an exceptional beer for the occasion, since its reddish hue strikes a perfect balance between the darker beers of winter and the lighter beers of summer. Its flavor is also perfectly balanced between the sweetness derived from malted barley and the bitterness derived from whole hop cones. \nThe Irish Red style was first brewed in Ireland by Franciscan monks sometime in the 14th century, which was long before stout became the national drink. The use of unmalted roasted barley reflected the Irish tradition of dodging British-imposed malt taxes while adding depth and complexity to the ale's character. It gained appeal as a restorative brew to slake the thirsts of farm hands at harvest time and, later, industrial workers after a day in the factory. An exceptionally drinkable quality characterized this ale. The same can be said for Workingman's Red, which has a deep mahogany color and a slight, malty sweetness up front. This rich foundation and flavor is surprisingly smooth due to the perfect balance of noble hop flavors. It finishes with a toasty mouth feel and a bold, aromatic hop character that compliments the up front sweetness exquisitely. \nWorkingman's Red is flavorful enough to satisfy discerning tastes, but still quaffable enough to quench the mighty thirst of the workingman. Strike a balance this spring with Workingman's Red.",,4.77,1.047,1.010,,spring,201,16 oz,,"Great Western Pale Ale Malt, Great Western 120L Crystal Malt, Great Western Flaked Barley, Bairds Brown Malt, Bairds Roast Material","Chinook (Bittering), US Golding & Tettnang (Flavor and Aroma)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mesmerizing brew is well balanced with a wonderfully complex yet unassuming malty sweetness and a delightful yet unobtrusive flavorful hoppiness. The finish is delicate and crisp with a wonderfully pungent hop aroma. This outstanding balance of malt and hops makes Scarecrow ESB a very savory, yet very smooth and satisfying brew. \nAs we move into autumn, a bridge or stepping stone from the smooth, crisp golden ales of summer to the dark, heavy winter ales is needed.

This ""winter warmer"" highlights the rich, toasty, aromatic and chocolaty malt fl avors as its very sturdy foundation. Generous amounts of four different hop varieties were added in fi ve different additions that will deliver a magnifi cent hop assault on your taste buds.

Also, when it is mixed with the special Belgian yeast it will give a fruity aroma and taste. The beer is hopped very lightly with English Kent Golding hops so as to not overpower the spices. Finally, in keeping with tradition, it is spiced with coriander and orange peels. Also, like all other Wit beers, it is unfiltered.

We also use a traditional Belgian yeast, which imparts a distinctly fruity aroma. Finally, we spice the beer with white pepper and a combination of orange and lemon peels.

The result is a light brown colored ale that is pleasantly aromatic with a sweet, malty taste.",,,,,,retired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Floyds Brewing,Select Mocha Porter,,Porter,"Our Mocha Porter is made with British pale and American caramel malts. We also have flavored it with a hint of mocha to add a pleasant chocolate taste and aroma. This will compliment the sweet, malty flavor of the beer.

There is just enough bitterness to compliment the sweetness of the malt.",,,,,,retired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Floyds Brewing,Select Rye Beer,,Rye,"Our Rye beer is made with rye, pale and victory malts. To create a bold flavor, we use more rye than in most rye beers. The ratio is 40% rye, 40% pale and 20% victory malts. The victory malt gives the beer the pleasing aroma of freshly baked bread and is a perfect compliment to the rye malt. The beer is hopped with American hop varieties without a trace of bitterness, allowing the full rye flavor to come through.

Three Floyds Brewing,Select Cream Ale,,Cream Ale,"Our Cream Ale is slightly different than most other beers of this style because ours is a little darker. We did this to make it a more flavorful beer since most other cream ales are fairly bland. We used pale malt and some light colored caramel malts to give the beer a deep golden color. These malts also give the beer a full bodied malt character. We used North American, German and English hops to give the beer a distinct hop flavor and aroma. The result is a bold and flavorful ale that can be enjoyed in the spring and summer.",,,,,,retired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Floyds Brewing,Select Hefeweizen,,hefeweizen,"Our Hefeweizen is a traditional Bavarian style wheat beer. It is made from 50% malted wheat and 50% malted barley. The wheat is used to give a distinctive flavor and, because of its high protein content, a light hazy color. The beer is fermented with a German yeast strain that imparts a banana and clove-like aroma and flavor. We used Hallertau hops, but only in very small amounts so the flavors from the wheat and yeast will be predominant. This beer is not filtered so it will be cloudy in appearance, but will still be very refreshing.",,,,,,retired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Floyds Brewing,Select Imperial Pilsner,,Imperial Pilsner,"Our Imperial Pilsner is similar to the Czech original, but all of the flavor characteristics are increased or ""Imperialized"". Thus, the beer is slightly darker, maltier and has more hop aroma than the original style. Also, because our water in Abita Springs is remarkably similar to that in Pilsen, we do not have to artificially adjust our water to achieve a similar taste. Our Select is made with Pilsner, Munich, Cara Munich and Cara Pils malts. In keeping with tradition, it is hopped and dry hopped exclusively with Czech Saaz hops. The resulting dark golden beer has a sweet malty taste and floral hop aroma.",,,,,,retired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Floyds Brewing,Select Belgian White,,Belgian White Ale,"Our Belgian White is made with light pale malt, malted wheat, unmalted wheat, and oats. The oats are added to give a very light color as well as body to the beer. The wheat is used for a couple of reasons. First, with its high protein content, it is used to make the beer cloudy. Also, when it is mixed with the special Belgian yeast it will give a fruity aroma and taste. The beer is hopped very lightly with English Kent Golding hops so as to not overpower the spices. Finally, in keeping with tradition, it is spiced with coriander and orange peels. Also, like all other Belgian White beers, it is unfiltered. This will make the beer slightly cloudy, but it will also make it more flavorful. The result is a cloudy but light colored beer with a pleasant fruity aroma and refreshing aftertaste. Summer is approaching which means that an Abita Belgian White will be the perfect refreshment to get you through the sultry summer heat.",,,,,,retired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Floyds Brewing,Select Nut Brown Ale,,Nut Brown Ale,"Our Nut Brown Ale is meticulously crafted with British pale and crystal malts, as well as specialty roasted malts from the U.S. This gives the beer a very malty flavor and aroma, with hints of nuts and baking bread. In keeping with tradition, it is hopped and dry hopped with the highest quality English Kent Golding hops. The Hops give the beer a subtle earthy hop flavor without overpowering the malt character. The result is a bronze colored ale that is refreshing and pleasantly aromatic with a sweet malty taste. Our Nut Brown Ale is sure to please anyone who is looking to explore brews with flavor and diversity.",,,,,,retired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Floyds Brewing,Select Pale Ale,,Pale Ale,"Our Pale Ale is made with Maris Otter Pale Malt from Norfolk, England. Maris Otter barley has been a favorite of English brewers for decades because of its rich color and exceptionally full-bodied flavor. We liberally hopped and dry hopped our Ale with American Cascade hops and fermented it with Pale Ale yeast. The use of our pristine and unaltered Abita Springs water softens the bitterness of the hops. The result is burnish orange ale with a rich body, fruity esters, and a snappy fresh citrus hop flavor.",,,,,,retired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Floyds Brewing,Select Bohemian Pilsner,,Pilsner,"Our Bohemian Pilsner is made with malt from Weyermann, a famous Bavarian malting company. The malt bill consists of Pilsner, Cara Pils, Vienna, and Melanoidin malted barley. The beer is fermented with Munich Lager yeast and is hopped and dry hopped 100% with Saaz hops from the Czech Republic. The result is a medium body, deep gold color brew with a sharp clean bitterness, floral hop aroma, and soft malt sweetness. The snappy hop bitterness and the taste of barley linger on the palate.",,,,,,retired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three Floyds Brewing,Select Kristall Weizen,,Weiss,"Our Kristall Weizen, ""clear wheat"" is made with malt from Weyermann, a famous German malting company. The malt bill consists of wheat malt and Pils, Vienna, and Cara pils malted barley. The beer was fermented with Weizen ale yeast obtained from Doemens, a German brewing school. The brew is lightly hopped with German Hallertau Hersbrucker hops. The result is a well balanced, gold color brew with a fine, slightly sweet body, fluffy head, and subtle flavors of clove, banana, and vanilla. The beer finishes with a fine acidity and is light on the palate.",,,,,,retired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Belgium Brewing Company,Fat Tire,,Amber Ale,"Named in honor of our founder Jeff's bike trip through Belgium, Fat Tire Amber Ale marks a turning point in the young electrical engineer's home brewing. Belgian beers use a far broader palette of ingredients (fruits, spices, esoteric yeast strains) than German or English styles. Jeff found the Belgian approach freeing. Upon his return, Jeff created Fat Tire and Abbey Belgian Ale, (assuming Abbey would be his big gun). He and his wife, Kim traveled around sampling their homebrews to the public. Fat Tire's appeal quickly became evident. People liked everything about it. Except the name. Fat Tire won fans is in its sense of balance: toasty, biscuit-like malt flavors coasting in equilibrium with hoppy freshness.",,,,,,year-round,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Belgium Brewing Company,Sunshine Wheat,,Wheat Ale,"SUNSHINE WHEAT is a great beer for trouncing thirst. Yet, it has a depth of character that inspires a quiet moment's reflection.

Our far-flung Beer Rangers affectionately refer to our Fort Collins brewery as the Mothership, a name that conjures images of earth shot from space and the interconnectivity of it all. Mothership Wit is brewed with wheat and barley malt, as well as coriander and orange peel spicing resulting in a balance of citrus and sour flavors held in suspension by a bright burst of carbonation.",,,,,,year-round,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our first foray into lagered beers, Blue Paddle Pilsener-Lager, is a Czech style pilsener with a refreshing crispness from noble hops and a rich, malty finish. 'Blue Paddle' refers to the implement our warehouse manager's Grandma once used to lovingly paddle his a** when she caught him stealing sips of her beer. With more body than a traditional Belgian pils, Blue Paddle is reflective of Europe's finest pilseners.",,,,,,year-round,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Belgium Brewing Company,1554,,Black Ale,"Born of a flood and centuries-old Belgian text, 1554 Enlightened Black Ale uses a light lager yeast strain and dark chocolaty malts to redefine what dark beer can be. In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.",,,,,,year-round,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Belgium Brewing Company,Abbey,,Belgian Style Ale,"Winner of four World Beer Cup medals and eight medals at the Great American Beer Fest, Abbey Belgian Ale is the Mark Spitz of New Belgium's lineup - but it didn't start out that way. When Jeff and Kim first sampled the beer at the Lyons Folks Fest, reviews were mixed at best. One of founder Jeff's first two Belgian style homebrews (along with Fat Tire), Abbey is a Belgian dubbel (or double) brewed with six different malts and an authentic Belgian yeast strain. Abbey is bottle-conditioned, weighs in at 7.0% alcohol by volume, and pairs well with chocolate (or boldly served by itself) for dessert.",,7,,,,year-round,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Belgium Brewing Company,Trippel,,Belgian Trippel,"Our Trippel Belgian Style Ale (pronounced triple) opens with a bold blast of hops that slowly gives way to the fruity esters implied by our Belgian yeast strain. The Three Graces hand-painted on the label are Zeus's daughters Aglaia (splendor), Euphrosyne (mirth) and Thalia (good cheer). In the Belgian tradition of brewing singles, doubles and triples, Trippel is the strongest with the longest fermentation. Remarkably smooth and complex, our bottle-conditioned Trippel is spiced with a trace of coriander.",,,,,,year-round,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Belgium Brewing Company,Mighty Arrow,,Pale Ale,"MIGHTY ARROW Pale Ale provides lots of pleasurable sniffs from Amarillo and Cascade hops with a fetching honey malt base. This is our brewed tribute to Arrow, Kim's Aussie/Border Collie mix who ran (literally) New Belgium for 12 years.

New Belgium Brewing Company,Skinny Dip,,,"New Belgium's Skinny Dip started out as a challenge from our founder Jeff to brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert. Jeff was looking for a full-bodied, highly drinkable beer for after workouts - something a little lighter than the rest of the portfolio. Peter, a Belgian, responded: ""Only in America would I be asked to brew a beer with no calories and less alcohol."" The challenge was to give the beer body and complexity not usually found in beers at the lighter end of the spectrum. Cascade hops frolic with a hint of lime leaf, making Skinny Dip a bright, refreshing splash for the summer season.",,,,,,summer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Belgium Brewing Company,2°Below,,Winter Ale,"Pull on your wool socks and crack open a 2° Below Ale. This tasty winter warmer started life as a small batch beer brewed for the Al Johnson Uphill Downhill – a telemark ski race in Crested Butte, Colorado. The Uphill Downhill celebrates the exploits of Al Johnson, letter carrier extraordinaire, who delivered mail by ski in the late 1800’s. Dry hopping during fermentation creates a floral nose with a hint of pepper and spicy, subtle undertones. 2° Below provides a bright, hoppy palate and a cheery warm afterglow.",,,,,,winter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is deep ruby in color, with flavors just as rich. Every year, New Belgium sends a delegate to the Pacific Northwest to oversee the process of turning freshly picked berries into a pure juice to be added in fermentation.

Bottle conditioned with our special house strain of Brettanomyces (wild ale) yeast, Le Fleur finishes dry and slightly herbal.\nProduced for New Belgium coworkers to celebrate our 15th anniversary, Le Fleur has roots in the earliest days of our history. In 1988 founder Jeff Lebesch sat weary on the side of a Belgian road when a young lad passing by picked a delicate yellow flower and offered it to Jeff.\n""Le Fleur, Misseur?""

Envisioned by our own Matty “Smooth” Gilliland, this beer opens with sweet clove and banana notes that give way to a chocolaty warm finish with a peppery tingle across the palate. ""I thought it would be fun to make a German wheat beer; we've explored the Belgian wheats pretty thoroughly,"" said brewer, Matt Gilliland. ""Since this is Lips of Faith – and part of what makes that program fun is to make beers that are really unique and different – making a big, strong, dark Weiss beer sounded pretty folly-licious. It'll still showcase all of the flavors that a Hefeweiss beer would have, but add in the burly body and extra punch. Think of it as a Gran Cru dunkelweiss.""",,9,,,,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much darker than a traditional kriek with a dash of sour cherry up front, our Dark Kriek is actually a blend of two beers.

New Belgium Brewing Company,Lips of Faith Abbey Grand Cru,,,"Before there was New Belgium Brewing, there was Abbey Ale. It was the first beer of home brewer and New Belgium co-founder, Jeff Lebesch. So the love brews deep for Abbey Grand Cru.\nTo date, Abbey Ale has garnered no less than 16 medals at the Great American Beer Festival--7 of those being Gold. Take that award-winning recipe, precisely increase the hops, malt and fermentation time, and the result is a Grand Cru worth collecting. And that's exactly what many of us at New Belgium, as well as a growing number of fans, have done.\nBy saving it for a few years, Abbey Grand Cru will continue to improve and age deliciously. Optimal storage is a cool (40-55°), dark place where the bottles can remain undisturbed. But lest we forget, it is a great beer and great beers deserve to be enjoyed. Best served at cellar temperature in a wide-mouthed glass. Toast to the monk's virtue and have a heavenly experience.",,9.5,,,,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brewed with barley, oats and wheat malt, Biere de Mars' celestial orange hue inspired the planetary play on words.

Lemon peel coupled with the lemon verbena imparts fruitlike character and a citrusy finish.",,,,,,spring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Belgium Brewing Company,Lips of Faith Dandelion Ale,,,"The newest offering in New Belgium's Lips of Faith Program, Dandelion Ale, was inspired by the great hop shortage of 2008. Dandelion greens have a natural bittering effect much like hops. Reveling in the freedom of the Belgian brewing tradition, we thought this ubiquitous weed would make an interesting addition to a traditionally hopped beer. The result is a strong blond ale brewed with toasted pilsener malt, flavored with fresh picked dandelion greens and grains of paradise. Dandelion Ale is hazy and light gold in color with peachy aroma and a Belgian yeast strain. It has a unique bitterness, subtle maltiness and a creamy mouthfeel.",,7.8,,,,limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This authentic kriek beer began life in the oaken vessels at Frank Boon's brewery in the Lembeek region of Belgium. After more than two years aging, Boon's offering shipped across the Atlantic and found its way to the intuitive palate of New Belgium's Brewmaster Peter Bouckaert. After much sampling and internal consultation, Peter and his brew staff created a full-bodied golden lager to round out the light-bodied kriek. The cherry nose gives way to a pleasingly sour flash across the palate that rolls gently into a slightly sweet finish.
