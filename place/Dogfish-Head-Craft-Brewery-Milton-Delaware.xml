  <description>Off-centeredÊales, for off-centered people... that's what we do here at Dogfish Head! Whether it's weird ingredients,Êsuper-strong extreme beers, or crazy, made-up styles, you can be sure that a beer from Dogfish will challenge your perceptions of what beer is supposed to be! We make, bottle and keg most of our beer in our Milton, Delaware brewery - check out our brewery tour for a peek! We also have a small brewery inside our Rehoboth Beach, Delaware brewpub. That's where we do our experimental batches - the funkiest of the funky!Ê</description>
