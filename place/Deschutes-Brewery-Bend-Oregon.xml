  <description>Deschutes Brewery, located in Central Oregon along the banks of the wild and scenic Deschutes River, has brewed a family of handcrafted ales since 1988. Starting out as a small brewpub in the heart of downtown Bend, DeschutesÕ first beers were Black Butte Porter, Bachelor Bitter and Cascade Golden Ale.

In 1993, Deschutes moved into its current brewing facility and has continued expanding and improving the facilities. With a 50-barrel traditional gravity brew house and a new one-of-a-kind 131-barrel Huppmann brew system from Germany, Deschutes now creates and experiments with specialty batches of limited beers like The Abyss and Hop Trip while brewing large quantities of everyoneÕs favorites like Mirror Pond Pale Ale. Consistently producing the highest quality beers is always DeschutesÕ number one priority and commitment.</description>
