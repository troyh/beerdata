	<name>Boston Beer Company</name>
	<description>JIM KOCH FOUNDED THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY IN 1984 BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THAT AMERICANS DESERVED BETTER BEER. Today, we&#xD5;re a team of about 350 people, and we all share a common passion for bringing great Samuel Adams&#xA8; beers to beer lovers everywhere. We&#x27;ve worked hard for the many successes we&#x27;ve enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any beer in history. Jim has been named an &#x22;Entrepreneur of the Year&#x22;&#x22; by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, most recently Samuel Adams Utopias and Samuel Adams&#xA8; Chocolate Bock.</description>
